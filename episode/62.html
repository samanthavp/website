          <span class="transcript text">Welcome to Episode 63 of the Raw Talk Podcast. We hope you're having a lovely summer. Over the next two episodes, we will be sharing the intriguing and inspiring panel discussions from our second annual raw talk live event, Medicine Meets Machine: the Emerging Role of Artificial Intelligence (or AI) and Healthcare, that took place in May at J Labs in the MaRS building.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Stephania Assimopoulos</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[0:32]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">AI is a very current topic rapidly gaining popularity in what seems like almost every scientific field, and not without a good reason. AI has led to various advancements on many fronts. In medicine, for example, it has led to the development of cutting edge treatments and diagnostic tools. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Grace Jacobs</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[0:48]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">However, besides all the hype surrounding it, is also burdened by many misconceptions and even suspicion. So on this year's live event, we decided to keep it raw when it comes to AI to gain a better understanding of what AI is, while clarifying some common myths.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Stephania Assimopoulos</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[1:01]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">At our event, we unpacked this topic with two distinct panels of experts so that we could talk about AI in two different perspectives. Number one, the current applications and limitations and number two, the ethical and future considerations of AI in medicine. Our panelists share diverse perspectives from healthcare, academia, industry and policy development.</span>
        </p>

          <span class="transcript timestamp">[1:21]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">In today's episode, we will share with you the discussion from the first panel on current applications and limitations.</span>

          <span class="transcript timestamp">[1:27]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">We also want to take a moment to thank our sponsors J Labs who let us use their fantastic venue, the Syrian initiative fund SGS, EMSA, UTGSU, News, and of course, IMS.</span>

        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Grace Jacobs</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[1:38]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">A big shout out to Dr. Lu, the director of IMS for introducing our second panel. Let's begin by hearing a bit more about our moderator, Dr. Shreejoy Tripathy and panelists doctors Oren Kraus, Jason Lerch, Marzyeh Ghassemi and Joanna Yu.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Shreejoy Tripathy</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[1:38]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">So I'm Dr.  Shreejoy Tripathy. I'm a new independent scientist at CAMH and Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at U of T as of January 2019. I'm part of the new Krembil Center for Neuroinformatics at CAMH. And our Center's goal is to use the power of big data, artificial intelligence and brain modeling to treat mental illness. The focus of my lab specifically is how to understand how an individual's genetics affects the functioning of the cells in their brain. And we use AI specifically to help draw associations between different scales of brain organization, like between human genotypes and neuronal physiology. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Oren Kraus</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[2:26]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">So I'm Oren Kraus, I'm one of the cofounders of Phenomic AI. And I started the company based on some of the techniques I developed as a PhD student here at the University of Toronto, those working in the machine learning group with Professor Brendan Frey and some other collaborators in the Donnelly center. And we were really the first to apply AI to image based microscopy screens. So on the academic side, we're using those for functional genomics to figure out where genes localize to in cells and really understanding more in genome wide screens. But in industry, these types of technologies are used a lot for drug screening. So there's really a huge opportunity to apply AI to these types of screens, as a company. So that's kind of where we started off two years ago. And since then, yeah, we've grown to a team of over 10 people, and we're using AI on these kind of screens every single day.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Shreejoy Tripathy</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[3:13]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">That's really exciting.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[3:15]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">I'm Marzyeh Ghassemi. I am a professor at the University of Toronto and computer science and medicine and a faculty member at the Vector Institute, I do research in machine learning for health. So my primary appointment is in computer science, which means a lot of what I do focuses on developing models and methods that I think are going to work really well with health data. So we already know how to process image data efficiently with convolutional neural networks, we already know how to process graphs efficiently with graph convolutional neural networks, we know how to work with text using recurrent neural networks, a lot of data that comes out of a healthcare setting doesn't follow a lot of the same ground rules when you're trying to learn things efficiently. And a lot of the speed up that we get and learning now is because we know how to model data efficiently. And so you can learn really well, even if you have very little examples of a specific minority class. And so the research that I would like to do moving forward is focusing on learning what kind of models work well in healthcare, and correspondingly, what kind of healthcare actually works well for people.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Jason Lerch</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[4:18]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">So I'm Jason Lerch. I'm at the Wellcome Trust Center for Integrative Neuroimaging at the University of Oxford, and I still have an adjunct appointment at the University of Toronto and SickKids, which is where I was at until recently, I'm going to again make the curmudgeonly argument that we're using AI as an extension of statistics and that it's part of a long continuum that has a very proud tradition in medicine, and that it's part of the toolkit that will help to try to understand both how to more optimally solve detailed problems, as well as to make better predictions about what our data is telling us about subjects, patients, participants, molecular and biological systems.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Joanna Yu</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[4:53]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Yeah. Hi, everybody. Um, so I'm Joanna. Yu, I'm a colleague of Shreejoy at CAMH and the Clinical Center for Neuroinformatics I'm working on the BrainHealth DataBank as a Senior Project Manager. So unlike the rest of my fellow panelists, I don't actually conduct AI analysis myself. But I'm really interested in ensuring that there's high quality data sets available for people to conduct AI, for the purposes of both transforming care and informing research.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Stephania Assimopoulos</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[5:18]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">We were really excited when putting together this panel because, as you'll find out soon, our panelists although all AI users have quite different perspectives, which made for a lively and engaging discussion, suffice to say that an agreement was not always reached.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Grace Jacobs</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[5:33]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Before we dive in, what is the technical definition of artificial intelligence or AI? It's often a broad term used to encompass many methods and ideas. I definitely personally get lost trying to narrow it down. So how do our experts describe AI? Doctors Marzyeh Ghassemi and Jason Lerch gave a great definition to help clarify,</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[5:51]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Artificial intelligence is the colloquial term that's used to describe many methods that are used by statisticians, people who do optimization, people who do computer science. And we use these methods often to either do unsupervised learning; clustering, supervised learning; prediction, or causal/reinforcement learning, trying to understand cause and effect in data. So it's a large class of models, and it's a general term.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Shreejoy Tripathy</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[6:25]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Jason</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Jason Lerch</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[6:27]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">It's hard to top that. It is statistics where you don't have to predefine your model exactly,</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Grace Jacobs</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[6:32]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Or equivalently, AI is a tool to find patterns in data with the help of machine learning, as Dr.s Kraus and Yu pointed out. Okay, now, let's dive in.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Stephania Assimopoulos</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[6:41]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">AI is often thought to be the holy grail of modern innovation, revolutionising technology, and leading to drastic progress. But that isn't necessarily the case, or is it just not the case yet? To understand the importance of AI, we wanted to know from our panelists how their respective fields work, prior to using AI, and how they are now starting off with Dr. Oren Kraus.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Oren Kraus</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[7:03]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">So yeah, the field of generating lots of microscopy data, it's called high content screening. And there's still a lot of data science that went into it just using the traditional computer vision techniques. So things like segmentation and feature extraction.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Audience Member 3</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[7:17]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">What was it like before that?</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Oren Kraus</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[7:19]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">It's really like...</span>

          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Shreejoy Tripathy</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[7:20]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">dudes looking at photos?</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Oren Kraus</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[7:22]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Yeah, the scale came. And then, you know, once you had like, all these images, it was really like an afterthought of like, Okay, how do we analyze them. So in the big, the bigger companies were more focused on just kind of narrowing that down to a specific measurement. So something simple would be like cell viability, like are the cells alive or dead under this condition versus not. But the trend in the last 5 to 10 years has been thoroughly try to extract more and more information. And that's really where the content part of high content comes in. So measuring lots of parameters at once from every single cell and these large scale experiments. But what AI lets us do that really only took off in the last two to three years is really take a lot of the engineering that goes into that, because it would take weeks, months, or even years sometimes to analyze all these images. But now you can really apply the exact same techniques over and over again, and get results almost as fast as you can generate the experiment in the first place. So it really makes that whole tool set a lot more productive and a lot more useful.</span>
        </p>

          <span class="transcript timestamp">[8:15]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Can you give us a sense for just the amount of data you're talking? Are you talking like two slides or like 2 million?</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Oren Kraus</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[8:20]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Yeah, so the idea with these automated screens is you can image a whole like 384 or 1536-well plate within a matter of hours. And then the pharma companies will screen like, you know, 10s to hundreds of plates. So the data sets can be 300 gigabytes, to terabytes. And then, you know, you've generated that within a few days and want to analyze that almost as fast as you can generate it.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Audience Member 3</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[8:41]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Marzyeh if you wanna go next.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[8:42]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">It's a hard question for me, because, you know, I was a computer scientist first. And so I think that the the big shift in medicine is that if you watch a doctor, at least in the ICU, and I spent a lot of time and ICUs during my PhD at MIT, so I rounded up at Israel with some of the attendings. Patient would come in, and I swear, they would look to me exactly the same as prior patients, and the doctors would, the senior doctors would call it. They would say, this one's not going to make it there, they're going to die. And I would say, okay, you know, I have my like, notepad Why? And they said, I'm not sure I have a sense I have these different words give shoulde sense, like, but they all essentially said the same thing. I just, I have a sense. And when you probe them on it, as annoying future academics do, right, they would finally come down to you know, I saw a patient once who had something like this, it was a while ago, but you know, it sort of looked this way. And so this makes sense to me in my in my head. And that makes a ton of sense. So you know, if you talk to the doctors, they'll tell you that they operate in a shocking lack of evidence right. You know, there is no compendium of every patient that's ever been seen and all the treatments that have been given to them. Nobody writes a textbook about that, if you're lucky, you'll get a case report about a bizarre patient, right. And people are trained reasonably consistently at very high profile academic hospitals. But you know, these teaching hospitals, they train you, and then you go off wherever you're going. And maybe you don't retrain, and maybe practice changes. Maybe you haven't seen a patient who looks like this very recently. And so I think that the the difference that machine learning can offer that AI and other tools can offer are, we can look at all the patients who have ever been seen in an institution, not just your institution, but everybody's institution. And we can see what kind of treatments actually work well for patients like the one you're seeing. And I think that that's amazing, because even the best doctors have to really think when they look at a patient, and then they can make that prediction. I think that we can make doctor's jobs more about providing care and less about guessing. And I think that that will improve care for everybody.</span>

          <span class="transcript text">I think the main thing I would add is that in my part of neuroscience and brain imaging, and the more clinical side that I'm involved in, I don't think AI is had that big of an impact yet. So it's more coming. And I think the biggest association and where it's coming now is in ... AI is starting to replace what we can do with more classic image processing, and sometimes classic statistics. But it can yet or has not yet helped in improving understanding. And I think that's one of the big things that probably have more of a discussion of today, in terms of to what extent can you have a large data set and learn what we already know, and apply it much more efficiently and potentially more robustly? And to what extent are you trying to get something new out of it?</span>

          <span class="transcript text">Can you ... I'm just gonna push back on that. So can you give, quickly give an example of what you would mean by understanding?</span>

          <span class="transcript timestamp">[11:59]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">So what I mean is, what very often happens with AI algorithms is that you can provide a large training data set. And you can say, can you discriminate, and to use the example we just heard cases that will make it in cases that will not? And then it'll tell you, I can do this with 88% accuracy or whatever the numbers might be. And then starts, what's almost a process of archaeology of figuring out well, what is it about these patients? Which can often be very difficult to learn from especially more complicated, deeper neural net, or whatever it is that you've used to apply this tool, compared to the more classic way of analyzing the data where if you use multivariate statistics for massive univariate statistics, where the accuracy wouldn't be anywhere close to that high, but our ability to interpret what the models are telling us is still higher.</span>

          <span class="transcript timestamp">[12:43]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Right. So there's the ... Challenge is, you know, these tools seem to work, but no one really, maybe you don't know why or how they work.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Jason Lerch</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[12:51]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Right. And there's a lot of really interesting work happening in that field of trying to understand and interpret the output of what did the learning algorithm learn? But it isn't always immediately clear. Why is this actually working?</span>

          <span class="transcript timestamp">[13:02]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Yeah. Joanna, can you speak a bit to so the brain health data bank account is still being built? But can you speak a bit to maybe some of the promise of or maybe what, what is going to go in it? And then how we're hoping that? Oh, yeah,</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Joanna Yu</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[13:14]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Definitely. So I think, I think the further to Marzyeh's points about, you know, being able to compare to similar population, then predicting whether or not the patient will will receive a positive or negative outcome, in order to be able to do that, we really need to be able to have this data centralized, standardized of high quality, and I think that some of the largest amount of challenges going across, she's nodding, she moves across hospital, even within a hospital. And so part of what the brain health database is doing is really looking to ... that are integrate clinical and research data and also improve the quality of it, you know, can we have standardized assessments being used across clinics as appropriate, can we then layer on additional research measures, including blood  samples, or even wearables, so that we don't just have data from when the patients come into the clinic, but in their, in the real world, in their in their lives? And just to add to that, you know, I think where we're going is like, not only when they come in when there's something wrong with them, but even after the discharge can we continue to follow them to, to be able to really apply all these AI and machine learning algorithms to the full capacity except that they're able to, to hold promise for improving our future.</span>

          <span class="transcript timestamp">[14:19]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">So from what we just heard, AI has made an impact in some fields and contexts more than others, but also in different ways. AI is leading towards more personalized medical decisions based on evidence from big data sets. However, we need to rethink how to most effectively collect such big data sets, both in the short and long term for each patient. It's also important to look past the hype and think of what we have actually gained in terms of understanding while keeping in mind the challenges related to AI.</span>

          <span class="transcript timestamp">[14:44]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">So the question is like, what are some challenges that you face using AI in your work? Joanna, what... maybe we can start with you and I want to know, is there pushback from like the clinicians that CAMH in these you know, old school, old school doctors who are like, why do I need to like you know, use this measure? Or some other measure? And does this data really need to go into a database? And can we can we just do things the old way?</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Joanna Yu</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[15:05]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Yeah, so that's a great question. I mean, we're fortunate at CAMH to have worked with a lot of, we're working with a lot of programs that have already developed standardized care pathways. So in that sense, there's buy in from the clinicians and the clinic and integrated care teams to be at nurses and therapists as well to be following some sort of standard data collection process. But I think they're, you know, what's really neat about this process, that we're building it together, so a lot of it, it's co design, imagine, you know, we someone discovered this fancy AI algorithm, 90% prediction rate, we can tell who's gonna respond to drug A, positively, and we just sort of walked into the clinic told the psychiatrist, listen, we've got this. I mean, they've also had a ton of training a ton of background, they also understand that there's different circumstances for each patient that makes each case unique. And there's a need for personalized medicine as well. But I think we're not in an era where AI is to replace the doctor, the physicians, but at the same time, can we co design to expedite how we develop these algorithms, because there's certain expertise that is not captured by just the data themselves are certain inherent knowledge that is within the experts, psychiatrists, therapists, everyone that can also contribute and expedite how we how we move forward.</span>

          <span class="transcript timestamp">[16:14]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">That's cool. Oren, can you speak a bit to some of the challenges and implementing AI in your work? And maybe you speak a bit to, you know, using AI in a company?</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Oren Kraus</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[16:23]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Sure. Yeah, there's definite challenges on the infrastructure side. So you know, it's okay if you're a data scientist working on a specific data set, and you can get results relatively quickly. But once you want to build something that works reproducibly across like lots of different experiments, or whatever the data sources, you really need to put a lot of effort into the engineering and, you know, getting different types of skills together, in order to get that whole thing working. In terms of the AI component, you know, the idea of training supervised models where you know, conditions ahead of time that you care to classify, that tends to work relatively straightforwardly for what the field is interested in. And like, I think, in general, across all of drug discovery, or life sciences, actually discovering new biology or just new relations in general and the data sets that we're generating. And in that setting, it's a bit harder to apply AI. Because, you know, if you use some of these unsupervised clustering techniques, it's really hard to know whether you're finding something of interest or just experimental noise. So that's something we're actively exploring at Phenomic AI, and other researchers too, is how to design algorithms that really kind of let the biologists or their scientists interact with the with the results and also give feedback and kind of close that loop between the data science and the experiment.</span>

          <span class="transcript timestamp">[17:34]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">I guess the two ... and one have spoken to already a little bit, which is the separation between performance and understanding of gaining understanding from the algorithms. And the other big one. So far, still, the simply numbers ... is to train an algorithm, you very often need large number of samples being put in or large data sets.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Audience Member 3</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[17:54]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Yeah, and you get a sense for, you know, for your field, what numbers we're talking about here.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Jason Lerch</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[18:00]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">It really depends on the application. So I've seen two types of applications. One of them is where AI replaces image processing. And they're very often you can bootstrap your way to the right number of samples. So you might take a data set of 10,000 brains, you segmented using classic tools, you use that to train an AI algorithm that then does a better, more robust or much quicker job of segmenting the same brain. So I think they're less worried about it. But he's starting to talk about predicting patient response trying to find who is going to provide respond to what drug, and we tend to work in the world of rare disorders. There are seven patients in the world of that particular disorder, that's a very hard algorithm to train. Or I mean, seven is the except... is the extreme, but very often, it gets into the 10s, 20s, few hundreds with all sorts of heterogeneity and diversity in there. So if it's on the patient prediction type outcome, that's much more of a challenge when you're in the rare disorders world than it is in some of the more common fields and trying to understand how do you begin to generalize from one set of patient groups to another? And how do you begin to not... to train these algorithms when you don't have the classic training data set available? </span>

        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[19:16]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">I mean, people use calculators. There are already risk scores in the ICU, you come in, they like add up seven numbers. And they're like, Yeah, that one has this score, right? Like, it's a fancier calculator, if you want to use it that way, right? Like there's a convolutional neural network is just not requiring you to specify the features that you want. Like in the pre conv-net days, you had to say, I think something is happening at frequency 75 hertz. And no, seriously, you would talk to a cardiologist and they would say, like, look at this component of the QRS. And, you know, if you can just learn that from a convolutional neural network and get an equivalent categorization. I think it's fantastic. I think if we're talking about exploring new science, right? All techniques should be, you know, put under extreme scrutiny, right? If we're trying to predict new drug responses or something completely novel where we are doing completely new science, then it doesn't matter that that technique is AI, you should be terrified if your logistic regression model is super confident to., right? like, and I also had... this is this is a recent burn I had on a paper review, Somebody said, Well, you know, you should use a logistic regression model, because it's interpretable. And I want to know who thinks in log odds in this room? Who thinks in like e to the beta knot plus beta one x one plus ... nobody, nobody. I agree that low capacity models are often easier to look at, because we have ways that we have trained ourselves to look at them. But there are ways to look at high capacity models. So I don't think it'll solve everything. But I also think it's a tool just like all other methods we use. </span>

          <span class="transcript text">This was supplemented by Dr Lerch's compelling comments on the generalizability of these tools based on the task at hand. Unlike a calculator, it is variable. It's a more complicated tool than others we have used so far. And there are some key requirements to make it work for us like having good data. Although often presented as such, it's not a magical black box that would always do what we wanted to reliably. There are standards and difficulties associated with each case, and caution is required.</span>

          <span class="transcript timestamp">[21:49]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">We've spoken to this point a little bit, but can we hear a bit more about what's the role of human experts, or like, basically doctors as ... so these algorithms are coming online as they're improving? Like, do they still have a role? And if so, what is the role like ... Marzyeh, if you want to start? </span>
        </p>
        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[22:03]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Yeah, I think the machine learning for health community, at least the the people, you know, I know who worked primarily in EHR, in hospitals on longitudinal health records, nobody would ever claim that we're trying to replace the doctor, because that's not anybody's goal. A lot of what we're trying to do is provide better recommendations or better evidence or better options. But just like in most fields that automation has touched in some way, you always need a pilot, right? You always want somebody at the end of the line, who makes a decision about something. And I think the the sort of wrinkle for healthcare is think about other fields like like flying, right? You know, altitude is an absolute value, like, I know what altitude I'm at, right? You know, the plane, it crashes, or it does not crash, right? You can measure how much bouncing it does. So you can say how good a job your model did at landing the plane. So medicine, healthcare in general, is a setting where experts make decisions about what is the diagnosis, they can decide something is a syndrome one day they can combine it with something else another day. Decisions about diagnosis and phenotype are made by doctors, right? There are many conditions that used to be considered one thing, but now are multiple things, right? Because we've learned over time that they should be separated, science has made an adjustment. And so I think that while you know, experts get to decide what a what a condition is, experts are allowed to disagree. Which is ... which is very unique, honestly, in many of the fields that automation has, has transformed. Usually, if we say that's a chair, it's a chair, and every expert in this room will say it's a chair, right? But that's not true in medicine, if you ask if somebody is diabetic, and when they were diabetic people disagree about the onset time. And then even if you could have a complete compendium of these are all the reasons I might have an onset time. Do you have the data to establish that?</span>

        <p class="notes">
          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Shreejoy Tripathy</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[24:26]</span>

          <span class="transcript speaker">Dr. Oren Kraus</span>
          <span class="transcript timestamp">[24:28]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Yeah. So that's right. You know, like, even though, overall, even today, we probably be safer with ... if everyone had an autonomous vehicle, you know, we're still terrified of, you know, at least like one of them making a mistake, like, you know, once a year or something. And medicine, I think, like, yeah, like Marzyeh said, there's, it's not like we're gonna be replacing doctors, and they're still gonna have the final decision. So I think it's a matter of more of like educating doctors about how to use new tools. So that could be more of a generational thing. It might take, like the next generation of doctors to really adopt some of these newer technologies.</span>

So I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say a statement, and then you're going to agree and disagree. I'm going to quickly tally up the things and maybe ask one of you to say a quick comment about it before we move on to the next question. Okay, so the first question, AI can be more accurate than the decisions of human experts. For a freeze! We don't have our doctor on the panel drop out. I wonder what she would say. Okay, question number two, AI works in the same way that a human brain does. Oh, Oren why do you say agree?</span>

          <span class="transcript timestamp">[25:46]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Yeah, I think we learned from experience, we just experienced things a lot slower than that a computer would, right. So like, part of the reason that, for example, algorithms that are trained on a lot of data to make diagnosis are better just because they see tons of examples from tons of different doctors, whereas in your own life, you see, you know, however many patients you can see a day and you make those decisions, or in med school, you learn from, you know, case studies or textbooks. So, the amount of experience you have is very, very limited compared to what you can feed on algorithm.</span>

Question number three, AI is free of bias. Four solid disagrees. Cool. Moving on. AI that is good as one thing ... good at one thing will be good at other things. Four disagrees. Okay. And then one sort of controversial question. The use of AI in medicine has already led to the incorrect ... incorrect treatment of someone and their ... and their death. Okay, three agrees.

          <span class="transcript text">It depends on what you call AI. But if we're saying that, you know, risk calculators, right, our AI, right that like simple logistic regression models or random forests, the issue is, you know, humans deploy these things, right. And so I know, they ... a hospital where they made a risk score that did not include race. And the hospital administrator said that they noticed that they were actually having more ... more deaths in black patients who came in with pneumonia than white patients, because the the risk score was miscalibrated. And not because of any physiological thing. But because in this particular urban setting, I'm trying really hard not to disclose anything, there was a substantial low income black population. And so the assumption by some of the attendings who I knew personally was, if they came in and they had a fever, and they were shaking, they were withdrawing, they were on something and so they didn't do the prophylactic administrative ... administration of the antibiotic, because the risk score, you know, didn't take into account that there there are social determinants of health, right, that often overpower your age, your height, your glucose level, your heart rate,</span>

          <span class="transcript text">It wasn't really in the context of AI, but there was a wonderful article that I read, trying to say that there's a lot of overhyping of scientific results more generally. And they then traced it back and realized that most of that actually came from the quotes of the scientists given to the local press office, which then was being picked up by the journalist. So we might have to look in the mirror to see whose fault this is as well. </span>

          <span class="transcript text">Right? Yeah. How can we better inform the public at some about some of the realities of AI especially given that like, you know, it's still you know, this it's still nascent, right. Marzyeh's work is a great example but it definitely not perfect, right. And like self driving cars, you know, like they're driving on the road, and they're driving for hours, but they're still killing people. So what do we do in this like transition time to help manage the help manage the hype in the public.</span>

          <span class="transcript text">I'm not sure if it's different for AI than it's for anything and out of medicine or engineering that's coming out, there's often something comes out, everybody's very excited. And then over the years, it begins to settle more into here's what it can, here's what it can't do. And AI comes down to especially this idea that no matter how perfect the algorithm, if you feed in garbage to train it, you're going to get garbage out. And that's a lot where the solutions and as well as the realism is going to come in, it's hard to generate perfect data to train anything.</span>

          <span class="transcript text">I think you can also turn on the news media by like, highlighting someone who's got some examples where AI can't do something really, really simple. Like, if you go to some conferences, like NeurIPS, you'll see a poster where they're still training things on like, handwritten digits, just to prove that some algorithm works with like, for example, with like, low data only having like, you know, two or three examples per class. So that's something we can't really do yet with, with a lot of the machine learning techniques. So kind of communicating, like those limitations. And also, those are newer ideas, which aren't really fully scaled yet to the real world problems. But just showing where there's still a lot of room for improvement would really help people kind of put everything in context.</span>

          <span class="transcript text"> I had one thing that I that I think was it was said by a speaker at the Vector AI rounds yesterday that I really liked. And she ... the example she gave was not healthcare, she said, there was an intervention done in Tennessee where they reduce classroom sizes. And low and behold, all of those students did really well, right. And so they ... paper was published and some calls were made. And so the state of California decided to do this, right, reduce classroom sizes, and it failed miserably. The students didn't do better. And it's because they have a larger number of students that they have to educate. And so smaller classroom sizes meant teachers were going room to room there weren't ... they had to cover multiple locations, you were splitting up groups of kids who maybe ... were in teams together previously. And so one of the things that Dr. Kleinberg said yesterday in her talk is knowing the causal effect is not good enough, knowing the 80% positive or predictive value isn't. Knowing the necessary and sufficient conditions to reproduce that causal effect are. And I think that's what our limitations sections usually say. They'll say this only works in this case, under these conditions, we have this kind of algorithm with this kind of training. But that's often not what's spoken about.</span>

          <span class="transcript text">Yeah, right. Yeah. Sorry, guys. Sorry. So when this policy change happened, our models did really poorly, right. And you can imagine that that would be true, right? AUC is a point nine or suddenly point six. So from an 90% accurate, right to 60% accurate, it's because something changed, and the model was not aware of it, and you didn't tell it anything, right? It's assuming that it can go the same way.</span>

          <span class="transcript text">I mean, my recommendation to you 10 years ago is buy real estate. But I would say for you guys, if you want to focus on models, invest really heavily in understanding what you're doing. So I started ... I was I was just discussing that this. this past semester, I taught this machine learning for health graduate course in the computer science department. And it's supposed to be ... they gave it to me because it's like a light load, right? You expect, you know, 10 to 20 students in a graduate seminar course and 100 students showed up the first day. And so I had a quiz, pop quiz, about probability, statistics, inference, things that should have been covered in a ... an introduction machine learning course. And half of the students dropped. Which I think which tells you that, you know, there ... there are a lot of automatic things right now, right, you can download TensorFlow or PyTorch or Keras or whatever you want. There are pre trained ResNet models, it's easy to do. But if you're not aware of how these things are trained, it's really easy to misuse them, like shockingly easy to misuse them. And I don't want somebody to download code that, you know, I've written our student of mine has written and use it to discriminate against women and application essays, blackson probation hearings, or Southeast Asians in medical care. So take a lot of courses.</span>

So first and foremost is sort of ... and this is the approach that we're taking is working with them to co-design tools that allow them to use the data that's being collected in a easy, accessible, meaningful way for them, before we even get to the stage of returning these advanced algorithms, but really making it in a way that is interpretable.</span>

          <span class="transcript text">I think there are quite a few especially in terms of visualization of ... trying to understand what's happening with what are the patients that are being classified one way or another? What are the features that seem to have the most weight, most importance and all that. So I think there's quite a bit of effort. But I do think it is ... it can be a problem, because there's cases where you simply want the algorithm to be as accurate as you can. And then there's cases where accuracy matters less than understanding that comes from the physical output. And it's in that where there's still a challenge. I think there's work and it's fascinating work on it. But I think it'll remain a challenge for a while. But it's not that different from the more classic statistics as you move away from one or two variable linear model into, you know, a multivariate canonical correlation analysis, really understanding what that's doing isn't particularly easy, either.

          <span class="transcript text">Um, yeah, depends on the problem. But for images, you know, if it's, I think less than, you know, like 10s to hundreds of images per ... per category. But it's hard. Also, for cases where there's not clear classes, it's really hard to figure out how to use AI for that. You could use like some of the machine learning techniques, but not not necessarily deep learning. Also, yeah, just like understanding what your problem is first, before, like jumping to use AI is important. Because ... Yeah, sometimes like something really simple will work or just looking at the data will be a lot faster than then trying to use AI.</span>

          <span class="transcript text">You should not use AI to communicate end of life decisions to families, you should not use AI to have doctors, you know, interface with certain patients, right? I think in any field, you can probably segment out the things where, where you think I could probably just make that easier if I had somebody else do it. Right. I don't really care about how it gets done. I just want it to get done. Those things are things that AI probably can and should do. Right? If it's something where you think I really want to make sure that I communicate that correctly that I do that right, That's probably something that you should be doing right. So it's fine to me if for example, in my course, if I have an algorithm that goes through and grades all the code that the students wrote, but when it comes to deciding who plagiarized I make that call.</span>

          <span class="transcript text">So I'm interested in when things go wrong. So you mentioned in the hospital, the United States where the issues around because of not calculating in various variables, people died. So I'm interested in who's responsible?</span>

          <span class="transcript text">I think, and I didn't say very much on this previous to the previous question, I think that people hold AI because of the hype cycle to a higher standard than they do to other tools, the AI. So in that particular story, they were using an atom up model, right, it wasn't a deep learning model random forest ... it was just check this on the patient, give them a score from zero to five, check that give them a score from zero to five, they added that all up and they had a total score, and then they had ranges for decisions. That's very normal in most medical care, right. A lot of medical practice has these checklists, or these risk scores, that doctors are hand adding on sheets of paper. And so I don't think that AI should be held to a different standard than another tool, just because it has higher capacity. I think it should be held to the same standards, right? We have doctors are ... professional advice givers, just like lawyers and accountants and everybody else. we regulate professional advice givers, giving a professional advice giver a tool, I don't think makes them a worst advice giver. </span>

          <span class="transcript text">Hi, I'm wondering, is patient confidentiality a barrier to the true power of AI? And if yes, what could be a potential solution?</span>

          <span class="transcript text">This is possibly the worst, you know, burning question to ask me because I feel very strongly about this. So, in the United States, we have HIPAA, right. And HIPAA regulates the use of clinical data. And so if you d identify HIPAA, there's under HIPAA standards, there's 23 fields that are PHI, you get certified that you de-identified them to this standard. You were then allowed to release that data to researchers like me, so that I can run whatever model I want on my own GPUs, and is HIPAA compliant, because I have done the appropriate training in the United States, there's CITI training. Here it is CPTP training that has it's very similar. This is the equivalent you should have in your head to map to and I signed an End User License Agreement saying I would never try to re identify this and I would never try to redistribute this. And then me and my whole lab are able to use this data and this is fantastic. The US is definitely moving in this direction, right where they say, well de-identify things, and then we'll say that researchers should be able to use this in their work. I don't think that Canada is quite there in terms of social acceptance. And I'm a newcomer here. And so I don't know how quickly that's going to change. I'm hoping it's going to change really quickly. And I'm hoping that because at this point, I can easily work with many American datasets and British datasets. Right? But it's been very challenging to work with Canadian datasets.</span>

          <span class="transcript timestamp">[45:36]</span>
          <span class="transcript text">Yeah. So that's ... I mean, that that certainly is a challenge. And certainly on the clinical side, if you're looking to do initiatives that are striving for quality improvement, then you are able to access that ... that data for that purpose. And on the research side is, I think she covered all the points really there. We also have key HIPAA as well, you ... you are required to de identify it. And different models are used in different places. So for example, when you're in a research study, if you additionally want to gain access to data that was collected for clinical purposes, the research ethics board would have to give their approval and you would also have to obtain consent from the patient. So going forward, the question becomes, in our ... in our healthcare system in hospitals, do we want to empower patients inform patients that we are using their data for additional research questions beyond just providing them clinical care. And so that's a model that we're currently exploring is to .. to make patients aware as well and ask for their consent to be able to do these things.</span>

          <span class="transcript text">There's no doubt that AI is making an impact in medicine. Although we're still discovering its potential limitations and how we can use it in an optimal way. It's definitely important to keep in mind as Dr. Lerch shared, if we put garbage into AI models, we're going to get garbage out.</span>

          <span class="transcript text">As AI continues to be applied and implemented in medicine, it is essential that we improve knowledge translation to scientists interested in working with AI to healthcare providers integrating AI and to the public trying to navigate and understand the implications of AI. We hope this event and the episodes we're sharing are a positive step towards this goal.</span>
