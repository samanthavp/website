In this episode, we explore these connections outside the context of a pandemic. We learn how issues in global health are prioritized, funded, and measured; about the roots of global health in imperialism, and what it means to decolonize global health; and about the importance of highlighting local expertise and youth perspectives to strive for equity and improve health outcomes. We spoke with several leaders in global health, including: Dr. Erica Di Ruggerio, Director of the Centre for Global Health and the Collaborative Specialization in Global Health at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health; Dr. Ngozi Erondu a Senior Research Fellow at the Chatham House Centre for Global Health Security and a Senior Public Health Advisor at Public Health England; Jason Nickerson, Humanitarian Affairs Advisor with Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), and Colleen Dockerty, Registered Nurse and gender-based violence consultant, also with MSF; and Habon Ali, a Somali-Canadian community builder, who leads initiatives to improve health equity and remove systemic barriers to engaging youth in global health.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nishi"], "prod_team": {"cc": ["Stephanie Nishi"], "sh": ["Noor Al Kaabi", "Frank Telfer", "Nathan Chan"], "ep": ["Jesse Knight"], "ae": ["Richie Jermaine", "Alex Jacob"], "pv": ["Janine Truong"], "sm": ["Alison Wong"]}, "tags": [], "links": [{"title": "Dr. Erica Di Ruggiero - website", "href": "https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/institutes/centre-for-global-health/faculty-2/global-health-faculty/"}, {"title": "Dr. Ngozi Erondu - website", "href": "https://www.ngozierondu.com/about"}, {"title": "Dr. Jason Nickerson - website", "href": "https://www.jasonnickerson.ca"}, {"title": "Apathy is Boring (Habon Ali) - website", "href": "https://www.apathyisboring.com"}, {"title": "Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) - website", "href": "https://www.msf.org/"}], "transcripts": [{"speaker": "Noor al Kaabi", "time": "0:00", "text": "What is global health?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Erica Di Ruggiero", "time": "0:02", "text": "It's a study that includes research practice, and focuses on health, but also increasingly a real call out to achieving equity and health for all people worldwide. As I mentioned, when I talked about COVID, it also really emphasizes the transnational nature of an issue, both in terms of its determinants, and also the solutions. It's a field of study. So that means that it actually doesn't just draw on one discipline, but many disciplines, and really calls upon collaboration, not just between and within countries, but also across sectors. Sectors, both in terms of academia, public, private, but also sectors in terms of things that happen within the health sector, but also outside the health sector environment, etc. So of course, we have global institutions like the World Health Organization, we have the World Bank, national governments, nongovernmental organizations, many civil society actors, but we also have an increasing rise in philanthropic organizations that are also really defining that global health arena. And an example of that would be the Gates Foundation."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ngozi Erondu", "time": "1:13", "text": "I think it's really important to start with the successes of global health. It started as international health is what we kind of talked about, like in the 90s. And it has been this experiment in collaboration, this experiment, in achieving collective goals to protect human beings from deadly pathogens, you know, it was very successful with smallpox, of course, and also very successful when you just think about immunization as a whole. Vaccine preventable diseases have decrease significantly. You know, in most parts of the world, we don't have to worry as much as children dying, before they reach the age of five years old. And so it's been like this amazing experiment, in working together in looking for problems that affect humanity, and finding solutions to those problems. It's also given us, you know, pretty large, bureaucratic, but also necessary organizations, you know, like, the United Nations, UNICEF, World Health Organization, World Bank, that really kind of helps us to manage and somewhat coordinate these goals and this effort to kind of bring all of humanity to a certain standard. So I think all of that is part of the history and the story of global health as well. The power dynamic and global health has always been, the power has been within the west, and really wider countries if you look at it, you know, there's this huge divide between white countries and brown and black countries, that the global health is also kind of been like this savior mechanism. And it's been this like, we help you, and you should be grateful type of dynamic, and that hasn't been useful."}, {"speaker": "Habon Ali", "time": "2:51", "text": "I do see global health as an area and a space that we can work to achieve health equity for everyone across the globe. And when I think about global health, I like to think of it through a social determinants of health framework. But more importantly, I really like the phrase, think globally, act locally. And I like this phrase, because it makes us think about the actions that we take on a local scale, whether it's in our communities and our cities, and how that can impact the health of our global community at large. And often, I think when we think of global health, or we often think of things that are happening across the world, not necessarily we don't think of Canada, and I'm not saying everyone thinks this way, but it's a common misconception that global health is something that's done abroad. But honestly, there's a lot of inequity within Canada. And there's a lot of areas that we need to work within to improve the health of all communities and not a select few, which is what is happening in our country today."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jason Nickerson", "time": "3:49", "text": "For a variety of reasons, you know, it's people who live in places where health systems just simply can't meet their day to day needs. There are people who are prevented from accessing care because of bad policies, whether that be in the way that health services are designed and implemented, or whether it's that they're specifically targeted and excluded from accessing the care that they need, or whether it's because the medicines and the vaccines that they need are too expensive. There's a lot of reasons why people are not able to access the kind of care that they need. And for me, MSF was an opportunity to shine a light, not just on the problems, but also some of the solutions for for how we can meaningfully close the gaps in access to truly life saving kinds of services."}, {"speaker": "Noor al Kaabi", "time": "4:37", "text": "You just heard from Dr. Erica Di Ruggiero, Dr. Ngozi Erondu, Habon Ali and Jason Nickerson, a few of our guests for this episode of Raw Talk.

We asked Dr. Di Ruggiero, how stakeholders identify and prioritize issues in global health, specifically, as it relates to resource allocation."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Erica Di Ruggiero", "time": "6:52", "text": "Some of the research I've been doing applies policy theories to try to understand how things get and stay or fall off or get back on agendas, you know, and allocation of resources that are really applied to keeping things like that on the agenda. It's really, really challenging, but I would say that what keeps things on the agenda, you know, in part, evidence contributes so there's a growing body of evidence that we need to address problem x, global actors and their power and the kinds of capital, both political and economic capital, that they can bring to an issue can also raise things on the agenda at the expense of other issues that may be also very important. And so I would say, you know, financial incentives are, as much as I would hate that to be the only driver certainly drive a lot of decisions, and so the amount of resources that get put behind things. So when a Gates Foundation makes something a priority, it certainly helps to elevate it on the agenda, because resources are going into it at the expense of for example, neglected problems. There are many neglected disease, that aren't getting the kind of resources to find solutions to because they only affect certain people in very poor countries. Now, that doesn't make them less important. But you can see where economic incentives and the power of certain individuals and institutions can actually drive an agenda and make something more important even though some things also merit our attention."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "8:27", "text": "We asked Dr. Di Ruggiero, which specific issues in global health are being underserved?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Erica Di Ruggiero", "time": "8:33", "text": "I bet you if you ask a question of the next 10 guests, and they may give you a different answer. I'll start with that caveat. However, let me talk about the nature of issues that I think are underfunded, relatively speaking. They tend to be the kinds of issues that really are looking at the social and environmental determinants of health. So how employment, gender influence our health, we have done I think, a really good job at funding specific diseases, not all of them because some are more neglected than others and conditions, but we continue to fund things in a more vertical and disease siloed way. And I would say that what cuts across many of these diseases, whether you're thinking about TB, or malaria, or a growing number of not just infectious diseases, but non-communicable diseases, many of these diseases are actually about the social and working conditions in which people live, and work and paying attention to those, what I call social determinants really, really need more attention. The second has to do with our climate crisis, which we can't avoid anymore, but the incentives aren't currently going in that direction. So I think we have to shift the way in which we fund things towards more of a horizontal way. So looking at what cuts across some of these very important diseases and conditions and issues. And the second area from a health perspective is to focus on the health systems that we need to strengthen to better address some of these issues. So strengthening health systems, and also looking at the social and environmental determinants of health. That is an orientation to how we fund I think is critically needed. And this is what the Sustainable Development Goal agenda is, I actually tried to shift our thinking towards."}, {"speaker": "Noor al Kaabi", "time": "10:32", "text": "Dr. Di Ruggiero, is alluding to the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs. Seventeen goals set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, designed to focus global action towards achieving a better and more sustainable future for all by the year 2030. There are also 169 targets, and 231 indicators to qualify the SDGs. A massive undertaking to track for each of the hundred and 93 nations that adopted the goals. We asked about the data collected to measure progress on global health issues and the SDGs."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Erica Di Ruggiero", "time": "11:07", "text": "I would sort of see this as like who, like who's producing the data? And who wants to know, right? Because it's very much driven in part by that right, what gets measured, you know, the geographic location, the context for that the governance level of the development and production of those indicators. So who was consulted on the development of those indicators? The \"what for\" which kind of speaks to the who, but also, what's the purpose, and who's funding it, because there's work being done, of course, or donors have interest in funding the production of certain measures related to indicators. So what is in it for them? And I'm not suggesting that there is always, you know, less than altruistic motive. But I think that also needs to be taken into account. And when you apply that to try and understand how policies work, I think one of the other challenges from the research I've done is not not all policies are actually well articulated. So it's not always very clear, you know, what was really the objective. And so we have to start making some assumptions. And the other issue is that most of the indicators that we currently have, including many of them that are part of the SDG agenda, are about measuring the problem. So you know, what's the percentage of people who are poor or percentage unemployed, don't get me wrong, those things are really important, but they're not actually about the solutions. And an example of a solution would be social protection policies, we do have indicators like that, but in terms of the balance, I would argue more of our indicators measure the status of the problem, and less so about what are the policy and program interventions aimed at changing that problem or the situation. And so the balance isn't quite right. So then you get a disproportionate number of measurement. And you know, this costs money, too, and resources to actually measure well, and we aren't necessarily always capturing critical data about the degree of implementation of a policy intervention. So I think we have some work to do in terms of increasing the number of indicators and some of the measurement strategies related to measuring the solutions and policies being one of them, and their kind of impact on different groups."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "13:31", "text": "We'll hear next from Dr. Ngozi Erondu. A Senior Research Fellow at the Chatham House Center for Global Health Security, a senior public health advisor at Public Health England, and co-founder of Global Bridge Group.  Dr. Erondu, specializes in health systems and global health security, and is a dedicated advocate for increasing health research, autonomy and capacity in countries across Africa. We asked Dr. Erondu about the weak links she's observed in global health."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ngozi Erondu", "time": "13:58", "text": "When I went to London School, I started working on looking at the meningitis surveillance system in Chad, Central African country. And I had the opportunity to kind of look at other countries in the same region that was dealing with how to improve their surveillance system for meningitis, but also just in Africa, there's the strategy called IDSR, which is integrated disease surveillance and response, which is really I mean, it's something that the US, Canada, the UK could actually really use because they really requires people from disease areas coming together and speaking weekly about kind of what they're observing. It has one health component, it's really an important tool. But in some countries in Africa, it's more it's superficial. They don't have the training or the motivation or the political will to do IDSR in an optimal way. But when you talk to people who are really kind of keen to detect diseases, they'll tell you exactly what they need. When you're looking at disease surveillance integration, you have to remember that we have multiple donors, we have a lot of donors, you know, we have the Gates Foundation and Rotary that is funding polio, we have the Global Fund, that is funding TB, malaria and HIV, we have USA ID that is focused more on, you know, this part or PEPFAR, which is focused more on malaria, President Jimmy Carter's Foundation, which focuses on guinea worm, and all of these people require, you know, reporting regularly, you know, some of these some, I mean, some of the reports are super extensive takes months, you know, just to get the data and put it in, and then they say, we don't actually have time to do the work,"}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "17:50", "text": "The prescriptive nature of global health creates a major disconnect between funding organizations and the people on the ground doing the work. Dr. Di Ruggiero also flagged how the data that's being collected is not necessarily useful data."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Erica Di Ruggiero", "time": "18:05", "text": "It's also what we're measuring or not measuring. So without reliable and meaningful data on those things, we can't measure the problem, we can't track progress, and we can't guide planning and policy reforms. So if I take one of the goals, which is SDG 3, which is about good health and well being, it includes a bunch of targets and indicators related to specific diseases and conditions, but it also includes some indicators around health systems. But if we don't have strong health information systems, which is, you know, a challenge in low and middle income countries, it would be really challenging to actually measure progress well. And so I think there is lots of work that can be done to strengthen the information systems that kind of underpin our data collection efforts so that we can better respond and develop strong health systems that meet the needs of different population groups, right? For example, you know, there was a recent review done of of health information systems globally, and one of the major weaknesses that was found was that data wasn't disaggregated enough to monitor equity, right? Or there was a lack of capacity to even analyze data. And so that's why we've started to see more calls for equity data, meaning data that's disaggregated. And where we can actually better monitor the differential impacts on how health systems are responding to different population groups, by gender, race and ethnicity, etc."}, {"speaker": "Noor al Kaabi", "time": "19:41", "text": "Sometimes emergencies like outbreaks, national disasters and armed conflicts define an obvious and urgent global health need. Doctors Without Borders or MSF from their French acronym are often amongst the first to respond. Jason Nickerson Humanitarian Affairs Adviser with MSF spoke to us about how data collection to assess the specific needs of each situation is crucial to an effective response."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jason Nickerson", "time": "20:06", "text": "Doing these kinds of assessments are quite tricky, right? You're operating with often incomplete kinds of information, you're in a often very dynamic kind of situation. And so you're trying to do an assessment to make a reasonably well informed decision about where to intervene, and how and so on. But depending on the kind of assessment that you're doing in some instances, there's actually very good kind of field epidemiology kinds of assessments that have been developed over many, many years to assess things like vaccination coverage, and malnutrition, and so on. And so there's agreed upon indicators and thresholds and international standards that, you know, provide some goalposts and guidance for trying to understand what these needs are. But in other instances, you know, it's much more difficult if you're coming into a severely disrupted health system and trying to understand something like what's the available surgical capacity? Or, you know, is there an appropriate number of inpatient beds or something like this. You know, these are really complex kinds of assessments. And so this is really where I think taking time and having quite experienced teams coming in to make sense of this to really make sure that needs are being properly assessed, you're taking into consideration things like sex and age and gender considerations to make sure that interventions are appropriately targeted and reaching the right communities, people and not inadvertently excluding people from accessing services. You know, there's a lot of different layers and factors that come into play in properly designing these kinds of interventions. "}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "21:42", "text": "As we've discussed how global health projects are funded, inevitably influences how different issues and projects are prioritized. Jason talked to us about how MSF is funded, and what impact this has on their organization."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jason Nickerson", "time": "21:57", "text": "Because we are largely privately funded, it allows us to be able to react into response quite quickly on the basis of needs, as I was mentioning, so we see a need, that's unmet. And we think that we have the operational capacity to be able to respond and provide assistance to address those needs. And then we can actually move very rapidly to be able to do that, because we're not waiting necessarily on, you know, humanitarian funding appeal, or on government grants or something else. So that's one of the things that sets us apart as being quite unique. And there's many other considerations behind the private funding model, including the perception that it allows us to maintain not just perception, but also the direct implementation of our principles, being impartial, being neutral, and being independent. Over the many years that MSF has been operational, you know, we've developed independent supply chains and logistic capacity that's internal to the organization as well."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "22:54", "text": "Joining our conversation with Jason was Colleen Dockerty, a registered nurse and gender based violence consultant who has also worked with MSF on several missions. Coleen expanded on what goes into planning a response at MSF."}, {"speaker": "Colleen Dockerty", "time": "23:08", "text": "So when there is an emergency, for example, right now Ethiopian refugees going into Sudan, or if there's a cholera outbreak, in a certain context, our emergency team will go and assess the need, assess the existing capacity to respond either to the government, the Ministry of Health, but also the vast number of many other medical humanitarian organizations, such as the UN. So we look at what are the needs, what are the gaps in the response and decide whether or not to respond, we do have the possibility to immediately and rapidly deploy through these emergency teams. So it might be setting up a rapid cholera treatment center very quickly, or it might be more thoughtfully designing a strategy over a longer term of how to respond to the needs. Or it may be saying this actor has this capacity to respond, or the reports we heard before arriving before assessing in this context, were not what we found on the ground and deciding not to respond. So ensuring that when we do respond we're responding appropriately, to the perceived needs of the population as well in ways that they will trust the medical care that's provided in ways that are accessible to them."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "24:25", "text": "We've talked a lot thus far about money and its powerful influence on global health. The power imbalance money creates often leads to poor outcomes when money is shifted away from local priorities. Dr. Erondu talk to us about the essential nature of grounding actions in local expertise and supporting on the ground organizations directly."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ngozi Erondu", "time": "24:47", "text": "I think aid organizations need to fund local organizations directly. I think, of course they should be vetted. Of course you should understand like, which partners you're working with, but there are a lot of amazing on the ground institutions, civil society organizations, advocacy groups that should be funded directly to do whatever that they specialize in. And I think that is how, you know, we work towards a more equitable and successful future full stop. You know, when I was in Guinea, I thought I was coming to help them to strengthen their surveillance, like kind of after they had the biggest kind of shock to their system, I thought I was coming to just like, help them, like, build up a surveillance system that they could use for just kind of routine health. But then we had another outbreak. And so I ended up responding to that. But by the time I came, there was so much more investment in local communities, you know, it's like, you know, as a foreigner, we come in and say, oh, this was a post French colony, we need people who speak French. Okay, well, when you go into the villages, they don't speak French, like only the educated Ghanaians speak French, who have gone to uni and things like that. And so it took a while, but we got there in the end. And obviously, we saw a lot more success with the interventions that we put forth. And if you think about, you know, global health as a whole, it works everywhere, you know, like, I have less experience with Canada, more with the US. But in the US like, yes, there are 50 states, but I'm from the state called Missouri, and I don't look to the capital of Missouri, for my trusty community leaders. I'm from a city called St. Louis, I look at St. Louis like that is my you know, catchment area. That's what I look at. And so I think is, you know, as close to the community as we can be, is important. I think taking the lessons that we've learned from global health, and translating them to a community level all around the world is what we can do to make global health stronger. I think global health needs to be smaller. And that's how it will be more successful by funding these communities, by translating these larger lessons into a specific community context, by working very closely with actual community leaders and kind of multiplying that over like states and provinces and countries and regions. I think that's how we make global health more equitable. "}, {"speaker": "Noor al Kaabi", "time": "26:59", "text": "Next, we hear from a Habon Ali, a Somali Canadian community builder who is actively involved in initiatives that involve health equity and removing systemic barriers for youth, especially those from racialized and low socioeconomic communities. She also provides an example of how actions may be translated from a global to a local level. But first, Habon shares her personal story about having a younger brother with a developmental disability, and the treatment her parents faced at the hospital. She talks about how these experiences guide her work in global health."}, {"speaker": "Habon Ali", "time": "27:32", "text": "My personal story actually guides a lot of what I'm doing here today. So both of my parents are were refugees from Somalia, they arrived to Canada in the 1990s. And growing up as a daughter of Somali refugees in an under resourced, predominantly racialized and immigrant community, I had a unique perspective in policymaking and community building. But there were very few opportunities for folks in our communities, especially youth, to engage in having our voices heard, engage in avenues, where we could be creating sustainable change that we knew our community needed. I also noticed something different in the way my parents were treated at the hospital. When I accompanied my father, health care providers were quick to provide me with a colouring book and say, your kids sit off to the side, he spoke English without an accent. So when I accompanied him, they would give me that colouring book. And whereas visits with my mother, you know, I was required to become the intermediary translator, she speaks four languages, English is the last language she learned. So I realized that with the same health care providers, that dynamic change, her presence was met with like, question of competence and condescending remarks. And I remember feeling frustrated, very angry, sad, when we left those meetings with physicians. And that was my earliest memory of systemic racism coming from the very same systems that were supposed to be sort of supporting a youth, my brother, but it also sparked my interest for community service and health promotion, and science. So I'm really thankful for that time. And I really believe that like, you know, our civic engagement is tied to our health in terms of who is heard, and who is not, and what voices are taken seriously, and who our political leaders and parties have political will for and push the needle for. And like I said to you earlier, I do view health in the social determinants of health framework. So I view that like employment, income, housing, so many different things can impact our health. And so I really do think that BIPOC youth do face a disadvantage in many institutions, including the health care system and our education system, in navigating political institutions that are meant to serve us. And this is one example that I have from my experiences Apathy is Boring. So in this report, they looked at youth engagement and political participation, and they found that there's actually a crisis in Canada's political culture. There's a perception of distrust between public and political decision makers, and few Canadians have strong trust in political systems, such as parliament, political parties and mass media. Many groups are made to be marginalized and vulnerable by systems of oppression. But for me personally, that has been exemplified in the experiences that black and indigenous youth have across this country and even being a part of building Canada's National Youth Policy, you know, going throughout Ontario, Quebec, and I even had the pleasure of traveling to Nunavut and learning about the experiences of youth across this country. While there are very distinct experiences held by black and indigenous youth, you know, these are not monolithic groups of people, there's so much diversity and richness and culture amongst, you know, both communities, there is similar threads in some of the oppression that we face from various institutions. And I definitely think that has negative health impacts. "}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "30:51", "text": "The history of global health is a history of colonialism and white supremacy. We asked Dr. Erondu about the importance of recognizing this history."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ngozi Erondu", "time": "31:00", "text": "Studying in the UK, I have mostly kind of read about global health history from a European perspective, which is why we use language like decolonize, because as we know, like the British Empire was one of the biggest empires in recent history. And so global health, or as it's known today, really was rooted in this colonial expansion of the Imperial arm of the British system. And so it was to protect the people that were going to the colonizers basically was to protect them, it was like, okay, we don't want our citizens dying in India, we don't want our, you know, from malaria, we don't want our citizens in Nigeria having different foodborne illnesses, so let's, you know, let's create research studies, a whole scientific branch of Tropical Medicine, so that we can really unpack what's happening, and we can protect our own. That's what it was for, you know, if you read some of the histories, even when they started discovering, like quinine, and ways to kind of inoculate themselves from malaria, they weren't sharing that with the population around them, it was for them. And so, colonialism and white supremacy are one in the same vein, you know, I mean, just full stop. You know, the fact that, you know, a group of people thought that it was okay to go to someone else's land, to enslave them or to take the resources or whatever to divide and conquer, to create, you know, false lines and call it a country, to initiate most of kind of the civil unrest, that the sectarian issues that we have in a lot of, you know, previous colonies. That is all out of white supremacy. You know, that is all about this belief that one group of people are better than another group of people, you know, like, yes, Spain and England, they fought, but they also exchanged kings and queens, you know, I mean, they found ways to live in peace, it's just not the same at all. And so I think, unpacking colonialism and global health is key to equity and equality, it's key to trying to write a lot of those wrongs. But the larger issue, I think, that needs to first be kind of unpacked and improved, and, you know, is the structural inequality between the global north and the global south because the global north has all the money.

First, is the global north or Western countries or white majority countries, looking at reviewing the systems that they have in place, and listening to the students in institutions, listening to minorities, in their organizations, minority populations or black and brown populations, listening to women, you know what I mean? And just really, because there are all these structures in place that has been there that continue to marginalize and oppress these populations, and these populations are continuously ignored and dismissed. And in order to really examine and understand the colonial nature of our organizations and institutions, we have to listen to them. I think the second part is more about the global south or less rich countries, but the global north still has something to do with this and is providing them a platform. So I recently wrote about intersectionality. And like, you know, obviously I have a lot of privilege because, yes, I'm Nigerian, but I'm also from the U.S. I also I speak a language not just in English, but in the way that I understand concepts and things because I was, I was raised in a majority white country basically, and I can navigate kind of the systems much more definitely, then somebody that was born and raised in Nigeria, you know what I mean? So that's one part of it. The second part of it is that I'm pretty middle class. Yes, I've worked alongside people that come from poor communities or lower socioeconomic status, but I have not experienced what they've experienced. So while I have a platform, I find it really important that they have a platform as well. And I think that there are a lot of barriers to ensuring that they have apart from one is this, you know, the structural barriers of them just not having the access because they didn't go to the universities, they didn't work for the organizations, they they chose to work for community organizations that are not well known, or well vetted, or, you know, that don't, you know, traditionally meet the standard of what a Western organization would say, is a good partner. That is something that I've noticed, for a lot of my colleagues in the global south is that they're quite hesitant to lean in, because they don't think their voices will be heard, because they're afraid to rock the boat. You know, again, it comes to that inequitable power. But you know, we need both to happen, we need both to happen, we need folks to lean in, we need them to have a platform to lean in, we need to create the environment for them to lean in. But there I think we have to start the next generation or the current generation of global health leaders have to encourage each other and that I think can fall on you and me as well, right? Like, since we do have privilege, how do we how do we share our privilege so that folks from less privileged backgrounds can lean in? You know what I mean? How can they stand on our privilege platforms so that they can have more of a voice? How can we write op-eds with them? You know, how can we amplify their voices on Twitter, on different social media platforms? Because it all matters. "}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "36:39", "text": "We continued our conversation with Dr. Erondu asking how language and rhetorical substitution contribute to white supremacy in global health specifically."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ngozi Erondu", "time": "36:48", "text": "We talked about like the systems of decolonizing global health, the global north and the global south when we really mean white majority, versus like everybody else, because another thing that happens when you talk about global north and global south, you include the minority and marginalized and oppressed populations of the global north, you know? So there are some funding organizations right now, that if you're like, if you're a black, indigenous, or person of colour, brand organization that wants to kind of work with a global south organization, they'll say, no, you can't, because you're part of the global north. It's like, I'm part of the global north, but I'm not receiving any of the benefits of being part of the global north. I am not a powerful entity of the global north. A lot of people don't look at it that way. A lot of people somehow kind of separate the imperialistic past to current times. I went one time to the Global Health Summit, which is a crazy name for this small group of people who gather every year in Berlin, and I remember saying it would be really good to talk about decolonize global healthcare, because there's a lot of like leaders there like everybody from, like the top leaders of global health go there. And like the the person who was running, it just kind of scoffed at me. So are we just talking about this? Are we actually trying to do something about it? And I think that one of the deeper conversations we need to have about decommonality is, what specifically are we saying? And how can we, you know, think of other words, how can we build a better lexicon that talks very specifically about what we're talking about? Otherwise, we're going to be dismissed all in one when we all could be talking about very different things. Like I talked a lot about, you know, institutional prejudice and discrimination in academia, which is not the same as you know, somebody talking about like, the legacy of colonialism in malaria, or someone talking about, like, you know, how Ebola wasn't actually discovered by Peter Piot, like, you know, there are all these different aspects that I think we need to pull out. And I and I think that's how we kind of upkeep white supremacy. I also think another way that we upkeep white supremacy, is who frames these conversations. So I think we need to have a lot more leaning out of white older men, not to say that they shouldn't be part of the conversation, is that they should be humble enough to include others in part of that conversation as well. And so I just think that type of dignity and respect should be given to, you know, everybody, basically."}, {"speaker": "Noor al Kaabi", "time": "39:10", "text": "The theme of humility and vulnerability continues to be a concept that is emphasized as being needed in global health. It's particularly important to have a critical lens towards the work one is doing to reduce harm, and ensure equitable practices. We asked Habon about the importance of teaching this to emerging global health leaders."}, {"speaker": "Habon Ali", "time": "39:30", "text": "A concept that I think needs to be emphasized more is vulnerability and justice in global health. And I think a couple of our professors have touched on it, but unfortunately, I haven't gotten it in the depth that I've wanted to learn. And hopefully, I don't know if I'll get that next semester, but it's definitely something that we haven't explored enough this semester. But just to think that, you know, as we're going through this program, we're learning how to be global health leaders, and we're going to all go different ways, whether that's continuing education or whether that's policy making, or whether it's community building efforts are working in various different sectors. But to know that historically, you know, there has been a lot of harm done in the name of science, there's been a lot of harm done in the name of humanitarian work, there's been a lot of harm done in global health, and how do we assure that when we conduct work, whether it's across Canada, or across the world, that we are reducing the harm that we have, or that we are shifting the power and even amplifying local communities to lead the work that they need to do. So that like, you know, we're not perpetuating that white savior complex that I see in a lot of global health work, but also in the principles of our research as well, ensuring that there's equity and that we don't create more harm than good when we enter communities that we are not a part of. So that's something I want to explore more, I haven't gotten the chance to do it. But I have a lifetime. So hopefully, I get the chance to do that."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "41:02", "text": "As we seek to decolonize global health, we must also ensure multidisciplinary participation from a wide range of different sectors in society. Advancing health requires everyone. Dr. Di Ruggiero discuss this in the context of global health, diplomacy, an emerging field at the intersection of health, public policy and global affairs."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Erica Di Ruggiero", "time": "41:22", "text": "In the last, I guess, 10 to 15 years global health diplomacy has started to gain more and more attention. And it's a process of engaging many actors to try to shape the global policy context that I described earlier in this podcast interview, and how it influences health or how health gets positioned in foreign policy negotiations. So we've seen this kind of expansion and the number and diversity of public, private and nonprofit actors, in part because of globalization. They're all competing for attention and resources. And many are trying to like influence these policy agendas. And so there's this real need to figure out how to best negotiate in this very complex space. And the second reason global health diplomacy is you know, gaining traction is that there's this recognition that sectors: trade, environment, labor, which was the example I just gave earlier, are operating outside of the health system, but they have a direct impact on health. And so this is where global health diplomacy sort of plays a role. And we've got lots of examples of how it plays out in different negotiations, led by governments, but influenced by civil society, by the private sector, by researchers, etc. But, you know, none of these actors are really all on the same page. Some have shared agendas. But in the global space, we're negotiating for resources, attention. I mean, earlier in this discussion you talked about, well, why is something not getting as much attention as others, you know, that's a negotiated process or set of processes. And I think, because we're talking about global health diplomacy, or also comes from a recognition that health is not always in the center stage, you know, it can be an afterthought, yet many of the decisions and actions that are taken in sectors outside of health can have a profound impact on public health. Because even though a vaccine may seem like a health driven initiative, you know, it still needs to engage many sectors from purchasing to procurement, the R&D and innovation sectors industry, obviously, because many of the pharmaceutical countries need to be invoked. But also bringing a health or health equity lens to the forefront so that at the end of the day, we're going to have fair and equitable access to vaccines, which is the the end goal here, I think, is absolutely critical. Because, you know, we know we're as strong as our weakest link here. But not everyone believes that or buys that argument in the same way, and revert back to wanting to protect their own interests, their own citizens, and not cooperate. And global health diplomacy, I think is really trying to encourage that the multilateral negotiations and discussions. And the vaccine, you know, topic is still evolving, right? But there are many other examples where this is really, really been critical. And you know, health, while it's not always at the table is starting to become an instrument of diplomacy, actually. And so it kind of gets brought in from behind sometimes just, but isn't always you know, the number one focus."}, {"speaker": "Noor al Kaabi", "time": "44:45", "text": "This question of who's at the table is central to how global health policies are developed. But it also impacts what value we put on perspectives from around the world and how different ideas are shared. We asked Dr. Erondu about the structural inequities faced by African scientists and scholars, in particular, seeking to advance global health knowledge."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ngozi Erondu", "time": "45:07", "text": "I'll just talk about it from my experience in academia. So, like the structural inequality in academia, like when it comes to, like global health research has to do with visas, you know, like, who has access to the best public schools in the world? Do you got I mean? Even conferences, you know, there's been so many times that some of the most intelligent and most prolific authors and scientists in poor countries can't come over to talk to us about these so they don't have a voice. And so their prominence actually diminishes because they have less visibility. You know, I think it was like less than 1% of first authors are from African countries. But if you look at the amount of research done in African countries Republica, that doesn't make any sense at all. COVID-19 is kind of like, not the great equalizer, but a little bit of the great equalizer, because rich countries are suffering as well. And yet you have research papers coming out with all the authors 20 authors being from you know, let's say Canada, the US, and the UK, about COVID-19 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and it's like, okay, not one Congolese author, like that's crazy, like the structural imbalance there is what journal editors thought it was okay to even publish them. Can you imagine a 20 author paper from Congolese researchers, Nigerian researchers, Ghanaian researchers about how political madness in the US is leading to higher or poorer COVID-19 outcomes? Do you think anybody would publish that? Do you know what I mean? They wouldn't? They simply wouldn't I've been on papers that are just African authors, and I recently in Twitter asked, \"How many people have had eight reviewers for a paper?\" like I've written a lot of papers, I've never had eight reviewers like it like, and it's because there's this assumption that if an African group of authors wrote a paper that is not as solid or it's not as good, you know, which is crazy. So that has nothing to do with, you know, our behavior or anything like that it has to do with how these journals were set up."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "47:15", "text": "Dr. Erondu expanded on the structural determinants of health, and explained how the global north unwillingness to recognize non white expertise is detrimental to health outcomes."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ngozi Erondu", "time": "47:26", "text": "Medecins Sans Frontieres, which I highly admire, their staff has really been speaking out on the colonial nature of the organization, and how that is detrimental to the people that they're supposed to serve. A lot of people that are being treated by Medecins Sans Frontieres, they don't have a choice, even if the the doctors are rude or dismissive. And the structural barrier is this power dynamic that not even the local staff can really speak up against, you know, the supervisors and that all the supervisors are white, all the supervisors are imported from other countries. And you can be doing everything wrong. Like you might have read that in Islam, you wash the body of people who die, clearly, you know, that is a transmission route. And it took months before practitioners on the ground were like, oh, we need like, you know, safe burials, like, how come there wasn't someone from Guinea that was there to tell them or even if you can't be from Guinea, there are other countries in that region that have very similar customs. And I just feel like you know, global health really dismisses the local expertise."}, {"speaker": "Noor al Kaabi", "time": "48:30", "text": "Colleen and Jason talked about MSF's, reflective and self critical culture and the work they're doing to elevate local voices."}, {"speaker": "Colleen Dockerty", "time": "48:37", "text": "I think we're also having difficult conversations about who is pushing for that change. And we know that there are limited opportunities for people from the global south within the current ways that humanitarian system is structured. And so I think we are needing to really look at our own organization, and many other organizations are doing this about who is experts whose voices need to be listened to, and how can we amplify the voices of our national staff, of our colleagues from the global south who have that on the ground experience, more on the ground experience and myself. Not only the individual voices, but how to change structures so that we can amplify those voices more and have more effective ways to then advocate for change."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jason Nickerson", "time": "49:28", "text": "Yeah, I mean, that's exactly what we're trying to do more of to make sure that the voices that we're bringing to the table are people who are directly affected by the issues that we're talking about. So Sudanese or a Congolese physician is going to be able to talk about health care in those countries in the way that I'm never going to be able to. They are the experts. They're able to speak with, you know, additional insight that I just don't have,"}, {"speaker": "Noor al Kaabi", "time": "49:56", "text": "As we briefly discussed earlier in the episode, one essential step towards the the goal of decolonization and equity in global health is advancing the perspectives of youth who are challenged not only from not having a seat at the table, but also by stereotypes about disengagement with political processes. We hear Habon's take on this."}, {"speaker": "Habon Ali", "time": "50:15", "text": "We made the first address why young people, especially young Canadians, feel disconnected from traditional political processes. It's not that young people, it's not that they're not politically informed. Young people are a lot of these things. It's just that there's a lack of trust with government, there's a lot of youth who have different and employment and socioeconomic outcomes that really impact how they engage with civic and democratic institutions. And a lot of young people don't feel like they have a say in what the government does. And the way young people participate are shifting, you know, as a lot of young people are swapping to forms of participation that they see as community based, non-institutional social movements, and that form of engagement. And that comes from young voices not being respected and not being heard or being tokenized in spaces of power. So I really think that it's important to give young people power and space, you know, there's a myth that young people are apathetic and that they're not engaged in democracy. But we are and we're leading, non-conventional forms of action. We've seen the political demonstrations that are currently ongoing; protests, marches, petitions, information sharing, that's like taking over all over Instagram feeds, you know, people are informed, and they want to be involved. But we have to make space. And I think, for youth, a lot of us want to have a seat at the table, because we have high stakes in the decisions that are being made, you know, we're going to be living with them for the rest of our lives. So because of these stakes, you know, young people tend to have, you know, radical forward thinking views. But we are not mistaken in having that, especially when we're looking at the magnitude of the crises facing our generation, these perspectives should be welcomed and respected and acted on. I really think youth, and we're not obviously, we're not a monolithic group, youth come from rural, urban areas, different cultures and gender identities, everything, we're coming with all of our, you know, different identities to the table. So definitely different youth have different perspectives to bring to the table. But I think the unique perspective of the entire youth group is that most of us tend to be forward thinking, we want action, and these voices should be heard, I think, because like I said earlier, you tend to be radical thinking. And this isn't necessarily bad, it's that we're young in the decisions that are being made. So to give you an example, we're currently in a climate crisis, we're living through a pandemic. We're living through a racial justice crisis. There's a lot on the table right now. And young people who hopefully, we're gonna hold space on this earth for the next 50 to 70 years. You know, if our life expectancy you know that that's different for different young people in the world, unfortunately, but we have high stakes in the decisions that are being made. And we will live with the repercussions of those decisions that are being made for the rest of our lives. So whether there's political precedents, or whether there's projects that are not aligned with climate just future, or whether it's that we're losing generations of young people because of systemic racism, and that they're being left out of educational systems, employment opportunities, they're not being allowed to shift in this future that we're building, they're excluded from the features that we're building. And that's really scary. So I think that unique perspectives that youth bring to the table is that we bring fresh eyes, we're really not bogged down by life, by the world, by red tape, by bureaucracy, we see things for what they are and we have often a moral responsibility to say and to act on things exactly as how they are. But we also bring the perspective of innovation and of that forward thinking for the future and the responsibility that we have for the earth that we'll be inhabiting for decades to come."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "54:01", "text": "As we've alluded to, in addition to listening to and learning from youth, there's also an essential opportunity to learn from actors around the world. As Dr. Erondo explained, health systems in the global north have a lot to learn from the practical experiences of those in the global south, in addressing health challenges."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ngozi Erondu", "time": "54:21", "text": "I've worked mostly in Sub Saharan Africa, where a lot of disease surveillance successes have been funded by USAID yet in the West, we actually don't have very good disease surveillance in some of our countries, you know. For example, in the States, because it's so fragmented, because it's a federal system, the CDC requests data but they don't necessarily always get it. The West can learn a lot from mostly Africa when it comes to the surveillance to be honest as they're very ahead of Asia, and even Latin America when it comes to disease surveillance because they're always dealing with kind of emerging or reemerging infections, but also because they've been invested specifically in you know this idea SARS strategy I think we need better systems for mandatory reporting. I think that a lot of our reporting systems in the West are delayed. I think that we also need to find ways to reach communities. In Africa, we call it sensitization. So you talk to the mothers, and you talk about the vaccines and things like that. So you educate them, and they understand it for themselves that it's important, and they're more likely to bring their children to get vaccinated during the appropriate immunization schedule. Whereas in the West, we've kind of just taken that for granted. And so we've seen a rise of anti-vaxxers, we've seen a rise of measles, and all these different things, and part of disease events isn't just monitoring the diseases, but it's also preventing the diseases, you know what I mean? It's actually surveillance doesn't happen without action. Whereas a lot of times, I think, in the West, because of power struggles, politics, all this other stuff, it does happen without action, we have like these huge surveys, but we're not able to do anything about them on a regional or even a state level, but definitely a lot of times not on a federal level, we're not able to act very quickly on things in order to, to stop the increase of certain diseases, the incidence of measles, for example. So we've been having more and more measles outbreaks for the past five years in the States, but the anti-vaccination movement has just gotten stronger. You know what I mean? And that's very scary. And I think we need to be more creative about like, how do we really engage with these communities because we have been successful as a public health community, global health community in other countries, like, people, people, like people from the west are not like markedly different from people from Sub Saharan Africa, or from Southeast Asia, people are people. So it's about finding ways to talk to those communities so that they can adopt healthy lifestyles, or agree with the need for vaccinations and different preventative measures for themselves so they can actually appreciate it and value it themselves. So I think that's one way to make our system better, other than just improving the system in itself, but also improving our actions to reduce disease prevalence."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "57:06", "text": "And concluding our conversation, we asked Dr. Erondu, what advice she would have for people who are interested in meaningful engagement with global health."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ngozi Erondu", "time": "57:16", "text": "So sometimes like speaking with you, you're a young white man who is interested in decolonizin global health, and some of the things that I have said, may sound like you don't have a place. But the truth is, we all have a place. And that's what decolonize Global Health is about full stop, we all have a place. But for a long time, you and me actually, because I'm from the west, we've taken up way more places than we need to. And the truth is, is that we need to share that space. And so anybody that's trying to come into global health, I think it's important to understand your privilege, understand, like your skills, but are also understand your weaknesses and understand the gaps in your knowledge. And it's not about you having to know everything, it's about you working in a complimentary fashion. So that we can actually achieve, quote, unquote, global health. Like I think what I want to achieve is collaboration with partners from all around the world, to fight against infectious diseases, that's what I want to achieve. And I think we all should kind of have this personal statement of what we want to achieve in our careers. And it needs to be towards human progress, not necessarily towards you know, dominating a region. That's not where you're from, or even one that's where you're from, like, even in Canada, like you're, you're not an indigenous individual in Canada, like there's so much you can learn. So it's like, what are we working towards in establishing what you want to work towards, and who you need to work with, to get there, I think is very, very important as you start your career in global health, and also just realizing all the ways that global health has benefited us in the west, or us as you know, white people or us as men, I think, if you can realize how it has benefited you and how you have kind of unmerited privilege, you can do different things to correct it. And I always think that, like people don't think that individual actions matter. But they matter so much. You know, I had this one supervisor at CDC, who when we would go to different countries, he would stand in the back, and I would sit in the front and it forced the people to talk to me, because if he sat where we sat, there's no way they would even look at me and like, what he's done for me, and maybe even for them, you know, it's been life changing for my career. Understanding like, because you give power or the you allow other people to gain power doesn't mean that it takes power away from you, meaning like it doesn't make you less when you give more room to other people, but I think it actually increases who you are as a person and what we can do together as a global health community. So really understanding your privileges and finding ways to leverage that for other people I think is really important. And then finally, I'll say like whatever you're passionate about, you should do it. Don't use anything from decolonize global health to, you know, count yourself out, count yourself in, but just do it in a more collaborative way."}, {"speaker": "Noor al Kaabi", "time": "1:00:12", "text": "And as we've heard throughout this episode, global health is local health. Habon leaves us with some parting words, emphasizing the importance of local engagement, and collaboration,"}, {"speaker": "Habon Ali", "time": "1:00:23", "text": "Global health and Sustainable Development Goals are not things that just happen abroad, they are things that are relevant to Canada. They are goals that are relevant to Canada, principles that are relevant to Canada, and work that we need to do in our local communities as well. So I would say like, just in your own neighbourhoods, or your city and your communities, who does not have access and who does not have what they need to be home, or have a home, have access to homes, have access to employment, have access to education, you know, because of the financial barriers, socioeconomic barriers, and different systems of oppression, I would say, look within your local spaces and see what organizations, communities that you can support in meaningful ways. And don't limit yourself to just the health perspective, because I think like we we've discussed in this discussion, there's so many aspects of a person's life that impact health, that we need to focus on, as well. There's so many things that allow someone to be healthy and to lead a good life and to meet the full potential of their lives. So I would say if you're interested in global health, definitely go listen to the academics and read seminal papers and do the important work, I guess, but also connect to people. And I think that's what drew me to this program and connects to the human experience. And reducing health inequity was one of the major challenges that I'm focused on, so I want to look at all the aspects that impact a person's health and create disparity and see how I can push back against that, create solutions with others and you don't have to do it alone. I've never done anything alone. Do it with someone do with a group, you know, we go further when we're together."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "1:02:07", "text": "Thank you to our guests.

Disabilities can impact people's lives in so many ways, depending on the nature of someone's disability, and the accommodations or supports they have access to.

And I actually did my undergrad at U of T in the pathobiology program. And then went and did a Master's of design at OCAD University focusing on healthcare service design. And then, in my late 20s, I began increasingly struggling with an undiagnosed illness that I've actually been dealing with since I was about four years old, I first started complaining of chronic pain, and some immune symptoms from the age of four. And around the age of 26 or 27, I became unable to continue working because my symptoms had gotten progressively more severe, being undiagnosed and untreated. I was also dealing with narcolepsy, which was not responding to medication at the time. So I was sleeping upwards of 16 hours a day. I essentially went and moved back in with my parents in rural Ontario for three years. And I say that I was working full time as a patient working on accessing diagnosis and care. I identify as disabled and chronically ill. And that's an important sort of level of detail for me because there are disabled people who are and who see themselves as healthy. I most certainly am not, I am much healthier than I was three years ago, I've been able to find treatments that have improved my quality of life dramatically to the point that I can now live independently again and work, but I still deal with chronic pain, I still deal with chronic fatigue, I still deal with the fact that I'm allergic to hot weather and can't go outside without experiencing hives and worsening of chronic pain for like about eight months out of the year here. You know, it's an ongoing thing. And I have to I have to be really mindful and conscious of energy and pain levels and it affects the way that I work. I work another disabled person and honestly, I don't think I would be able to function in a non disabled work environment anymore. So I feel incredibly grateful that I have a business partner who is also disabled and we're able to sort of support each other in our access needs and our needs for rest and things like that."}, {"speaker": "Seth Kibel", "time": "4:12", "text": "As Alex mentioned, they identify as disabled and chronically ill.

There's also Mast Cell Activation Syndrome and POTS and together Ehlers-Danlos, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome and POTS or Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome are known as the triad in EDS phases. As so Mast Cell Activation Syndrome essentially means that my mast cells activate irradically and they essentially have a very low threshold for what will set them off. For me that's everything from rice, hot weather, cold weather, overly hot showers, certain fabrics, certain cleaners. It's one that's treated with a lot of skepticism because people that how can you be allergic to all these things? I am very aware when I talk about it. And most of the people I know who share this diagnosis are very aware of that when we talk about it, we sound like hypochondriacs, and that's something that has been leveled against many of us. I was told that I was just a hypochondriac for years that I just needed to eat healthier, exercise more. In that time, my health degraded so badly, I say I lost my 20s to it. You know, I was attending school and trying to work in a store. That was literally all I did. And I didn't do it all that well. I was I was struggling and I'd get home and I'd literally just sleep until the fifth alarm I'd set the next morning, it went off and I was already 20 minutes late for my morning class"}, {"speaker": "James Saravanamuttu", "time": "5:44", "text": "26 years. That's how long it took Alex to receive their definitive diagnosis. One possible explanation that Alex mentioned for this delay, is that little was known at the time of the diagnosis, and even now, not much is known about their chronic medical condition and how to manage it. However, as Alex goes on to explain, there's a systemic problem with the way chronically ill patients are required to navigate the healthcare system to receive secondary care."}, {"speaker": "Alex Haagaard", "time": "6:10", "text": "It's a structural problem. Doctors essentially are expected to perform a role of gatekeeping secondary care. It leaves family physicians adequate time to deal with the things that they are equipped to deal with, and it delays access to care for patients who are seeking diagnosis. We also can't discount the fact that there are many, many Canadians who don't even have access to a regular primary care physician so if you're accessing primary care through an urgent care clinic, that broken cycle of care, as you seek referrals, it can absolutely derail you. So I think on that level, there's a systemic problem where we actually need to design better ways for patients to be referred to secondary care. There's the saying, don't confuse your Google search with my medical degree, as a common repartee to that within the chronic illness community, which is don't confuse your four hours of lecture with my 20 years of living with this condition. From the designerly perspective I come from, let's take at face value that you can get a lot of bad information from Google search, if you're trying to seek diagnostic information and that places like Web MD, their diagnostic algorithms are not effective. They're really not. Why is the onus on the patient to stop seeking information rather than to develop better algorithms? Patients are not going to stop seeking information they need to help and honestly, we could create so much more efficiency within the care system by actually enabling them to do that more effectively. And this is the thing too chronically ill patients, we actually do know what we're doing, because going back to that \"I've lived with this for 20 years\" - in that time, we do learn how to do research very effectively. I think there is a lack of understanding just how much knowledge is contained within chronic illness communities and how much that information sharing has been enabled by social media. We often talk about how like Facebook groups are terrifying because you know, these anti-vax and bleach cults, which are absolutely terrifying. But I thought my diagnosis because of Twitter. I actually had a doctor who lives in the United Kingdom, who shares my conditions, reach out to me over Twitter and say, obviously, she didn't say you have the speech that I think you need to look into these. And that was my starting point. And the more I started to look into them, the more pieces I was able to put together and there are fantastic communities, on Twitter and on Facebook, where either people who share diagnoses share practical tips around management, around accessing care within their region. I think that clinicians often underestimate the extent of the knowledge that chronically ill patients bring to the table. There's a sense that when you've been searching for a diagnosis for 20 years, that just means you're hypochondriac. No, often it means there is very much something wrong and they have a lot of knowledge that is worth listening to."}, {"speaker": "James Saravanamuttu", "time": "8:56", "text": "Alex explains that this inherent power imbalance between the patient and the physician needs to be addressed to reduce the health disparities affecting disabled people in our society. In order for physicians to provide comprehensive care to disabled individuals, the healthcare system should work to redefine the kinds of services deemed to be medically necessary, especially for disabled individuals."}, {"speaker": "Alex Haagaard", "time": "9:18", "text": "I think fundamentally, there is a problem within medical ways of knowing it goes back to the clinic when we created the role of the patient. When we move from the sick person, to the patient to someone who is a body upon whom pathologies are to be mapped. We lost something. We effectively disenfranchised the sick person within the clinic and created a system of knowledge where the words of the patient inherently hold less value than whatever we can see or name on laboratory pathology. And we've created this fiction where things are unreal until sort of validated by objective measures, while discarding the ways in which things that we consider wholly objective are actually wholly subjective. I think within Canada, there are a couple of major issues, one of which is, within the Canada Health Act, people in Canada are defined, are guaranteed reasonable access to medically necessary care, except neither reasonable access nor medically necessary are defined, which is a little bit of a problem. It leaves both of those essentially open to interpretation by health network, or potentially even by individual practitioners. So when you're dealing with something, this has been very much my experience that Canada is quite good at providing care, if you have something that is going to that's either sort of acute and tangible like broken leg, or something that's going to kill you in short order. We're pretty good about providing care to that we are miles ahead of the states. But if you have something that is not going to kill you immediately or directly, if it's going to kill you indirectly, or if it's part of I'm doing air quotes, \"just going to decrease your quality of life\", or if it's going to take years or decades to potentially kill you, there's nothing and like, this is the thing too, I got a diagnosis, I still wasn't really able to access any kind of care for my conditions. I'm largely self treating, with what I can get off the shelf. And with herbal analogues for medications that haven't been made available to me. I know when I tell half of my doctors this to the sort of grimace and sort of wash their hands of me because they think I'm, they always ask me, \"So what homeopath are you seeing? Or what naturopath are you seeing?\" And I say \"No, I'm I don't subscribe to those because they don't have a particularly logical basis in physiology.\" I would love it. If we could have a shift towards medically beneficial. I think that would be crucial for people with chronic illness. Illnesses that are they're never going to be cured and they're also probably not going to kill us directly, but they nonetheless drastically affect our quality of life. I think that is a huge, huge within Canada. And then I think also, we need to recognize the massive disparity that exists between access to health care in rural versus urban and suburban spaces and also between provinces. Because honestly, like I moved to Kingston, about a year and a half ago. I used to get angry with disabled people from Toronto who would talk about how much better our health care was in the States because I'd be like, I don't know where you're living, but the care you're describing is not what I'm receiving. I kind of get it a little bit more now that I'm in Kingston, because honestly, I feel like I've moved to a different country, that level of care that I've been able to access even during a pandemic in the last year. It's absolutely wild,"}, {"speaker": "Seth Kibel", "time": "12:23", "text": "Disability is more common than you may think. A 2017 statscan study on disability found that 22% of Canadian adults had at least one disability, yet ableism within the healthcare system is ever present and often leads to people being weary of accessing care when they're sick. You'll never hear from Wendy Porch, who is a leader in the disability community, and tells us about her sometimes dehumanizing experiences within the healthcare system."}, {"speaker": "Wendy Porch", "time": "12:47", "text": "My name is Wendy porch and I am the Executive Director at the Center for Independent Living in Toronto, also known as CILT. I am a cisgendered white, straight disabled woman and a mom. I've had my disability since I was a kid. I was born missing front of my right arm and part of my hand. I have grown up knowing what it's like to be excluded, and to be treated as though I'm different. Often a problem to be fixed. For me as a young disabled kid growing up the hospital that I went to was an evolution of the hospital that they lived in and it was called the Ontario Crippled Children's Center. So I grew up knowing every year I was going to have a visit to the Ontario Crippled Children's Center when I could finally read and found out what crippled meant it was kind of devastating, to find out that there was something fundamentally wrong with me because I just felt like me. I just feel like me. I'm a terrible singer that shouldn't be held against me. But there was a context. I was a medical problem that needed to be solved is also something that I grew up with. As the Academy has moved on in terms of the way that it thinks about disability, it's happening alongside people with disabilities and the way that we think about ourselves. Being able to talk to each other and make these discoveries and move towards something that respects our inherent dignity and sees us as people first. I had some encounters with some of my health care professionals that made me feel really embarrassed at times. I went to a teaching hospital and residents are part of that interaction. And one appointment, I sat there and I was really pregnant. It was kind of a regular appointment very uncomfortable. And my husband came with me to all of my appointments to which was really sweet, but it was just a second and the healthcare provider yanked my sleeve up and pointed at my arm and said to the resident standing with them, you can see here that she was born with a deformity, but she's doing okay in her life and she's going to be a great mom. And it was a very demeaning experience for me. I'm not used to people talking to me like that anymore. People did talk to me like that as a kid with a disability. And certainly at the Ontario Crippled Children's Center where you would have to stand in front of your x-ray in your underwear for professionals in the room to sort of you know, pontificate and think about how they were going to fix you. But it had been a very long time for me. Since somebody had spoken to me like that. I don't think that that is something that non disabled women, or parents-to-be experience. And I think in some ways for me, I was more concerned about what was going to happen when I had my baby. I was sort of thinking ahead in terms of diaper changes and feeding and breastfeeding. You know, how was I going to hold the baby? And I had asked questions about that repeatedly throughout the course of my pregnancy. Nobody had any answers for me, none. I do know myself, I thought I was going to be able to do not do. And I was for one of the first times in my life really asking for help. There were no resources for me, and nobody really had any answers. One of the repeated messages from me was that we've never had one of you before, we've never had disabled mom-to-be before so we don't really know what to do with you."}, {"speaker": "James Saravanamuttu", "time": "15:55", "text": "So far, many of our stories have been about the difficulties and seeking care for people with disabilities, and the stigma and embarrassment they face when they do access care."}, {"speaker": "Seth Kibel", "time": "16:04", "text": "As a young non disabled person, I have the privilege of not having to spend substantial amounts of time and energy worrying about my health and I acknowledge that people with disabilities often don't have that luxury because of the really important issues and care that our previous guests discuss.

And a big thing that everyone thinks about, regardless of ability or disability is sex and dating. Yet, there are widespread misconceptions about sex and dating for people with disabilities.

My research really started in kind of a broad view, more traditional media research looking at television, films, comic books.

On the one side, we have this belief system, that disabled bodies are fundamentally not sexually attractive. That biological difference, sort of bodily deformity, as it's called, is not something that is going to fit within regimes of sexual desire in North America and Western contexts or really actually any kind of global context. Then on the other side, we have this idea that disabled people are not sexual themselves. This might be born out on the belief that people with physical disabilities, for instance, are not physically capable of having sex, whether it is that they are literally impotent, that they are not able to get an erection if they're a man, for instance, not able to produce children, or that they just their bodies don't physically work in such a way to allow for sexual stimulation or participation. The other side of it, which is that we have a real tendency of thinking about disabled people as children. This might be because we also see disabled people as being dependent on others predominantly dependent on non disabled people, whether it be for care needs for sort of day to day living needs, for whatever reason, then we seem to bind that together so that like children, disabled people are thought to be not interested in sex, naive about sex, or in the case of people with intellectual impairments, that they're not cognitively able to understand sex, and therefore we should keep it from them, hide it from them, not tell them about it."}, {"speaker": "Seth Kibel", "time": "19:21", "text": "How do you think that those widespread social beliefs manifest in let's say how we educate young people with disabilities about sex and their bodies?"}, {"speaker": "Jeff Preston", "time": "19:31", "text": "Yeah, this is this is a great question and to answer it, I'm going to talk really personally on this one, my own personal experience as somebody with a physical disability growing up in you know, the 90s in Ontario. At my school, the the gym class itself was \"technically\" accessible at the physical gym, I get into, however, the room where sex ed was taught in high school was in a part of the school that was essentially inaccessible. The only way to get to that room was to go through a boiler room, which was not of course allowed for a student to be rolling up through the boiler room. What it meant was that I didn't do gym class like other students. I had a specialized gym class that was done, which was essentially just physical therapy for me. It meant that I received no sex ed training after I left elementary school. I got really just the very start of it in grade seven age. I missed a lot of details. This was something that was caused by inaccessibility, caused by the fact that gym class is not really designed for somebody who uses a wheelchair, but also designed by the policy that sex ed is tethered to physical education. It reveals this sort of idea that at no point was there ever a belief that I would need to have that information, there was never any desire to actually open that up. I was never even asked if I wanted to participate in sex ed. It just wasn't on the radar. I think that it is tethered into another little tricky subject, which is eugenics, specifically, the idea that disabled people maybe shouldn't be reproducing because that, of course, would be corrupting the gene pool. I think that this eugenic idea that disabled people shouldn't be reproducing also starts to take away some of the pressure to provide sex education. After all, why would you give Jeff Preston sex education? If Jeff Preston shouldn't be reproducing. If we take a step back and think about this rationally, there has to be some concern about the ways in which we are really putting people with disabilities at danger by not giving them adequate sexual training and education. A big part of sex education isn't just about how to use a condom, knowing how not to get someone pregnant, but rather, there's a lot in there about understanding their bodies, understanding the changes that happen with puberty, and also understanding consent, understanding what it means to say no, both as someone who might want to say it, and also someone who maybe needs to hear it. I definitely worry about the ways in which disabled people are regularly left to figure it out on their own. But also I wonder what it means to disabled people who look on to themselves and say, \"well, if I don't deserve to have sex, education, education, if I don't, if I'm not supposed to be receiving this than maybe this is in a world that I shouldn't be a part of, that I'm not supposed to be a part of it. It's something I'm not either going to be interested in\" which of course is just not realistic. Humans are sexual beings. That's just a reality."}, {"speaker": "Seth Kibel", "time": "22:40", "text": "So do you think that the depiction of people with disabilities within the media contributes to and reinforces the widespread social misconceptions of disabled people being inherently non sexual or undesirable like we were talking about before?"}, {"speaker": "Jeff Preston", "time": "22:55", "text": "Yeah, absolutely. I think going back to the earlier statement around we don't perceive disabled bodies as sexual, in part because it's just not something we typically see. And when we do see it, it tends to come out in very specific ways. As a great media scholar in the world with disability Norden. As Norton explains, disabled characters often find themselves in isolation, sort of the title of his books, Cinema of Isolation. That disabled characters tend to kind of just appear as these signular, siloed objects. They typically aren't necessarily fully integrated into stories to refer to Mitchell and Snyder. They tend to be a bit like narrative prosthesis, that disability is just in there to help move along a plotline to move forward or to identify traits of an individual, we don't tend to see them as fully fleshed out characters, which means, well why would they have romantic interests? Why would they have sexual desire? Because they're not actually people, they're really just props, they're objects to be used to allow other characters to, you know, show that they're good caring people because they take care of the disabled person, or to show that they're a villain because they are disabled and angry. Because of their bodily difference. When we do see instances of sexuality and disability, we don't typically see them intersecting with non disabled characters, that often when we see disabled characters having romantic relationships, when they are having romantic relationships with non disabled characters those relationships are often fraught with difficulty and anxiety, that often they fall apart. They're not relationships that can be sustained. Whereas on the other hand, disabled characters that partner with other disabled people are seen as being fruitful, functional, if only maybe \"a little cute\", quote, unquote, like a simulacra of non disabled sexuality, something to be enjoyed as being kind of sweet or pleasant then to show a little of my bias: I love to talk about Drake. Is if we look at Degrassi the next generation, that Drake, Aubrey Graham, of course, started from the bottom on Degrassi. In this show deeper his character, Jimmy Brooks. Yeah, we're already here, people are gonna be like, wow, that took you a long time to make your first Drake reference. Dr. Preston, you must be slipping. Within the character, Judy Brooks, basically, Jimmy loses his girlfriend because he's in a wheelchair. She doesn't want to date him anymore after his injury. He gets back together with an ex girlfriend, but that relationship doesn't work because, quote, \"she doesn't want to take care of him anymore.\" She doesn't want to be his nurse. And he doesn't actually find joy or happiness in a relationship until he meets another disabled woman in rehab. They eventually quote unquote, \"get married\". It's like an off screen marriage. That's the only way that you can actually find love because apparently only disabled people can understand each other and can connect on that level. There's an incongruence with disabled and non disabled. We have this idea that disabled people really need to only be dating \"their own kind\", quote, unquote. But I think it's rooted in this idea that we seem to think that if a non disabled person and a disabled person are to be in a relationship, that relationship will inevitably be a power imbalance. The non disabled person will enter into a caregiving role as opposed to a loving or a romantic partner role, a sexual role. The disabled person will not be able to connect well with the non disabled character, because the non disabled character doesn't quote, \"understand what it's like to be them.\""}, {"speaker": "Seth Kibel", "time": "26:35", "text": "And what kind of effect you think these depictions in TV and popular media have on the self esteem of young sexually interested and expressive young people."}, {"speaker": "Jeff Preston", "time": "26:44", "text": "It's tied up in this very sort of rational ablest understanding of disability, which is dis ability, if we just take the word and break it down this ability or lack of ability. The disabled bodies immediately marked as a body of lack, or a body of loss, a body that has suffered some sort of tragedy. This is why I think we ask people, but I think the tied up in this idea that disability is coded so naturally, as a loss of ability, as a loss from the non disabled standard, which is perceived to be normal, that we must, of course, then pity, we must, of course, offer sympathy. And we must also hold separate from ourselves. Because think what's happening under the surface here is that disabled people, in the same way as woman and man are tangled up in this discursive knot. I think so to do non disabled people rely upon disabled bodies as a way of trying to justify their own normalcy, to assure themselves of their normalcy by looking at these dysfunctional or non functioning bodies. I have to say, growing up with a physical disability, I was born as I alluded, I'm born with a disability. I absolutely had a ton of anxiety, as a young person as a preteen and going into teenager years. I really wanted to have a romantic relationship. I wanted to date just like all of my other peers. And I was deeply concerned that I would never even be given a chance. Women would look at me and say, \"that's not what I am interested in. That's not what I'm looking for.\" Because as I had understood it, as a young child, watch a lot of television, the girls are gonna go after, to some meme parlance, the girls were gonna go after the Chad's. They're all about the big, muscular manly men and that really just wasn't me. It's really hard to push down that little voice in the back of your mind, that's always asking, would this be different if I wasn't disabled? Would this be different if I was, quote unquote, normal? Or for someone of my persuasion, would this be different if we didn't devalue disabled people so much? Would this be different if people understood that disabled people can be loving, caring, sexy, fun, people? How much of that rejection is rooted in me as a person, and how much of it is rooted in the diagnosis? That kind of thing, it weighs really heavy on your mind. And it really in some ways corrupts the relationship that you have with people because then you're always second guessing. Right? You're always second guessing, like, is this person, kind of a bad person? Is this person judging me based on things that are completely manufactured or cultural in nature and not reflective of me as a person. That results in relationships in a really kind of strange way and you can understand why I have quite a few friends with physical disabilities who talk to me and say, very similar things, right, that they're like, \"I feel like I don't have a chance. I feel like a woman is not even gonna look at me as being a possible partner. I've always be sort of just \"the friend\".\" That's of course not actually accurate. That isn't to say that not hard. That isn't to say there aren't lots of barriers and obstacles. I think that it conforms to this very heteronormative understanding of sexuality and gender roles. Fundamentally, that's a nugget that we need to crack for a lot of reasons, but I would say disability and sexuality is just one of them."}, {"speaker": "Seth Kibel", "time": "30:16", "text": "Hookup culture like matching on apps, one night stands, one-off flings largely dominates how millennials date each other and have sex with one another.

It means that you are really making snap judgments on people based on a couple pictures and a few lines in a bio, whether or not you're even going to filter them out, like whether or not they're even gonna just talk to you, you're making that decision on a very small amount of information, which on the one hand, I think, is probably not good news for people with disabilities that have very apparent differences. On the other hand, I have friends that have actually really enjoyed and appreciated things like Tinder, and Bumble, and Grindr, because it's meant that they were able to kind of sensor the disability a little bit before making the move. So by having photos that didn't disclose their impairment, they felt that they were able to make more connections, they got more swipes, therefore they were able to sell themselves first, before adding in the disability afterwards. Now, you can get into all sorts of conversations about the ethics of hiding the impairment of quote, unquote, \"tricking people\" into a relationship and whether or not a relationship is actually even going to be solvent if it's based on missing a really key part of your identity. It's easy for us to say, \"well, you know, romantic relationships should be based on the whole person, it should be an understanding of not just their physical appearance, but also their characteristics, their sense of humor, their loving nature,\" It's all well and good for us to say that that's what really should be based on. But if that is not how people typically find a relationship, that's not how typically people are dating anymore, and especially right now, in sort of the world of COVID. I think that makes our conversation about disability sexuality that much more urgent, because there is really the potential that it could become even more difficult for disabled people to date, if we're now going to basically isolate our sexual relations in through this like marketplace, Amazon storefront of sexual relations."}, {"speaker": "James Saravanamuttu", "time": "32:46", "text": "As we just heard from our guests, ableism has systemic roots in healthcare, the media, digital technology and social institutions. So how do we go about changing this? Alex, Wendy, Karen and Jeff, are undertaking many initiatives to change how society perceives and treats disabled people and create space for disabled people to change the world around them based on their own lived experiences. For instance, Alex is part of The Disabled List. A link to their website is in the show notes. Trust us go check it out. When we went onto the website and clicked on the link, the first thing we saw on the homepage is \"This website is disabled\" in large font. When we saw that we thought the link was broken or the website was under construction, but it's only after we scrolled a bit further down that we realized that the website was not in fact broken. And that the purpose of the initial text is to encourage people to reevaluate their use of the term disabled and the connotations attached to it. We asked Alex, given our use of the term disabled in our day to day lives to describe things that aren't working optimally. Do we need to change the way we refer to disabled individuals in order to reduce stigma and ableism?"}, {"speaker": "Alex Haagaard", "time": "33:56", "text": "There's actually a campaign, a Twitter campaign #saytheword that was created by a disabled activists called Florence Carter long and it's essentially a push back against the tendency that a lot of us encounter to sort of euphemized disability, s say things like special needs are handi capable or differently abled, I think what we're trying to accomplish with the website is not so much to get people to stop wanting to name disability in people and in society, but to consider what are the assumptions that we make around disability when we use that? Within disability theory, there is what's called the medical model, the medical model when it recognizes disability locates disability in the body or mind and wants to fix it. And the social model locates disability in society and it says that people with a typical body minds are oppressed by society because it's not built in ways to include them. And this is really appealing to a lot of designers because hey, if society created disability, then it's effectively a design problem. We can design our way out of it. In some ways, this is very useful accessability standards for buildings in terms of ramps and push buttons really, really useful. But it also in our work at The Disabled List we find it re problematizes disability a little bit. It creates this lens through which disability is only considered in design in terms of how it can be solved as a design problem. And what we're trying to do at The Disabled List is look at disability as an identity and culture and say, okay, what are the experiences that disabled people share when they move through life in a body that is sort of stigmatized and viewed as a typical? What are the the cultural accomplishments and sort of cultural standards? What are what's the humor, the language, the artistic production that comes out of that? So I think, in using the word disabled the way we have on the website, what we're hoping to do is provide people with a moment of reflection on all those different ways of conceiving of disability within society and reflecting on the assumptions that they're making about what disabled identity is, is they're also using it interchangeably with broken, non functional deactivated."}, {"speaker": "James Saravanamuttu", "time": "36:04", "text": "So what kind of work do you do at The Disabled List?"}, {"speaker": "Alex Haagaard", "time": "36:07", "text": "A lot of the work that we're doing is consultation with design organizations, media organizations to try and trade them a) an understanding disability through this cultural and identity-informed lens, and how to take that into their organizations in an effective way. And one of the things that we try and get them to move beyond is compliance-oriented approach to accessibility, and again, with the acknowledgement that compliance based approach to accessibility have been really, really important for creating minimum baselines of access. So one of the things that we've worked on is developing guidelines for photojournalistic alt text. We were asked, you know, how does alt text actually differ from the caption? Because we're already trying to put information about what the image is in the caption and what the context is. What is added by alt text? And so what we were suggesting is that it should contain very brief level of formal analysis. And it should also be talking about the interpretive and subjective content of the image. And essentially, that as you're writing alt texts, you should be thinking about, what is it that a sighted person or person who is able to engage with visual content, what are they actually getting from that experience? It's not just about saying what's in the image. What is the actual image doing when you're able to engage with it? And sort of thinking on that question, and trying to express that textually within the alt text. And it was actually really interesting, because they said, well, that's a bit of a problem for us, because photos in journalism, they serve to convey emotional impact without sacrificing journalistic objectivity. It's a way of sneaking in a little bit of emotional content into journalism, which is famously intended to be objective. The moment that you explicitly name that content within the alt text, you are sort of admitted to the lie of journalistic objectivity. And those are the kind of questions that we're trying to engage with, what are the cultural experiences that are left out of standard accessibility processes? And how can we begin to engage those a little bit more meaningfully and experimentally to actually answer some things that often gets sort of left by the wayside in traditional design? I think there's something really interesting in that examining how personal and lived and embodied experience can inform design processes really deeply and get it insights that can never be captured by an outsider, because this is also things designers are sort of taught that empathy is their superpower. But the problem with empathy is that a you will never have access to all of the knowledge that someone has within their own body or specific cultural experience. No matter how good a research you are, there are some aspects of embodied experience and cultural experience that are just they're not translatable. Right? Any designer and design researcher who operates from empathy is interpreting whatever they find whatever they do gain access to through the lens of their own cultural and embodied experience so it necessarily introduces biases. I think instead of striving for and imagining objectivity. I think there's a real value in embracing that personal and embodied and subjective experience as a way of structuring design research."}, {"speaker": "James Saravanamuttu", "time": "39:14", "text": "The traditional research paradigm centers the researcher in the driver's seat. The academic researcher decides what to study, how to study it, and how to share the findings. Conversely, Dr. Karen Yoshida has been studying disability by emphasizing the lived experience of disability, and building teaching and research community partnerships, one of them being Wendy Porch, who we heard from earlier. Karen Yoshida is a professor at the University of Toronto, and engages in a field called critical disability studies, which analyzes disability as a cultural, historical, social and political phenomenon, as opposed to the classic medical lens."}, {"speaker": "", "time": "39:55", "text": "My name is Karen Yoshida, I'm a cisgender middle class, non disabled woman of Japanese ancestry privilege as a PhD trained academic, in the social inequalities of health and disability. I'm a professor within the Department of Physical Therapy and in the rehab Science Institute, as well at U of T, my relationships to disability or multiple I have disabled family members, friends and colleagues. And I've worked with colleagues, activists and other disabled positive allies in academia and in the community since 1984. What kind of work that I do? Well, my teaching and research work that I do centers, disabled people, and the broad and diverse disability community. I've worked in partnership with the community to teach critical disability studies within the physical therapy program since 1993. Philosophy of equitable partnerships, working with disabled people not on them extends to the research that I do, and centering disabled people through projects that give space for their voice, recovering their stories, and reclaiming their histories. What's really critical from a critical disability studies point of view is viewing disability as a social and constructed phenomenon. While people live with body and mind differences, these differences are not devalued with from a disability studies point of view, but reflect the diversity of human difference. CDS, or critical disability study does not reject medical care. But it rejects the framing that you've mentioned, James, about the framing of bodies and mind that are different as a problem. It rejects that framing, because it implies that difference is a burden and a deficit and a lack in somebody, therefore has to be remediated in some way. So this imperative, as far as fixing people comes from many different sources. But it largely comes from an idea of a normative standard of what bodies and minds should look like, how they appear, what people how people should speak, how they should talk, how they should move. So we have these kind of normative standards, that is a reference point so that anyone who deviates or departs from that, then is deemed to be in need of some kind of treatment. Why is critical disability studies important to clinicians? It is fundamentally important to clinicians. We we work with people with differences all the time, whether it's temporary differences, or someone who's living with something long term. So from a teaching perspective, to teach about disability studies, and that difference, or disability is more socially constructed, it's based on the disadvantage that people experience when they go into the world and have to deal with structures and practices that do not take them into account is really important for clinicians to think about. They need to think about how do I in a positive way work with people who know their bodies and mind better than I do? So let me just give you one example. We have another leader in our community who has lived with quadriplegia. He broke his lower leg. He uses a wheelchair, an electric wheelchair to get around. But they wanted to cast his leg straight, like straight up from the hip. So his leg was would be sticking out. He said you know what? He said that's not going to work for me. I have to transfer I have to get people to help me transfer. If I have my legs sticking out, like it's just gonna be impossible for me to transfer to my bed transfer to my car, whatever. He said, can't you cast my leg with my knee bent since the bone is the lower leg? And they said, oh, yeah, okay, fine, like no problem. So here's an example of someone who like knows her body, and knows what they need to do in life. And when negotiating, saying, look, if you can do it this way, then I can carry on with my life. If you do it the way you usually do it, that's not going to work for me, it's going to create a lot of hardships. So that's just a small example about how it's so important for clinicians to dialogue with disabled people, if they come to them for treatment, or for consultation or for understanding where the resources are. It's really important for health professionals to kind of check their bias and check their assumptions around what they think about disability, race or whatever. And in our physical therapy program, we do that we have students go out and visit people with disabilities, because we know that they might have, they'll say, I have no I have no assumptions. I have no biases. But when they start to meet people, they realize, \"oh, I do have some implicit way of thinking about disability that didn't come out until I had this visit.\" A lot of it is this notion that disability is a tragedy. That it is a burden and in meeting people who are out there in the community, living working family, volunteering, etc. They've come to realize that they have to think about their implicit biases and assumptions and kind of make sure that they don't fall into those kind of tropes, which of course are everywhere."}, {"speaker": "James Saravanamuttu", "time": "44:57", "text": "As Wendy mentioned earlier.

We are based on the Independent Living philosophy it doesn't support traditional models of rehabilitation, it does the opposite. It supports models of rehabilitation and of support that empower individuals rather than create dependencies. CILT operates on the philosophy of the Independent Living Movement, which was developed in response to traditional rehabilitation service models. And our aim is to develop and implement dignified social services that empower individuals rather than create dependencies. We have a number of significant programs at CILT. One of them is province wide so we are the provincial administrators for the Direct Funding Program, which is an innovative program that sees people with disabilities themselves, become employers and manage their own attendance services. And we provide support for that program across Ontario, there's 1000 people with disabilities on that program. We're also the administrators of the attendance service application center that is a unified application center for people within the Greater Toronto Area who want to access attendance services or supportive housing. We coordinate that in partnership with a number of organizations that provide those services in the community. We also provide what's called core programs at CILT, these are central to the idea of the independent living movement. They are peer based programs that see people with disabilities providing supports to other people with disabilities. We have an independent living skills coordinator that helps people in the communities to learn how to negotiate their own services and how to speak about what their needs are and the relationships that they have with service providers. We have peer based programming that provides opportunities for people with disabilities to connect with other people with disabilities to be able to negotiate issues that they might have coming up in their service relationship or in their relationships in general. We also have a parenting with a disability network that we support through our core programs. And we have a program right now called de next, where we are working to provide training opportunities to people with disabilities to learn about how to tell your story. We're supporting people to have training and podcasting and video development so that we see more stories that are authentic and come from disabled people that describe what it's like to be a person with a disability and show us in our own world. Why do I do the work that I do? I've had my disability since I was a kid so I was born missing part of my right arm and part of my hand. So I have grown up knowing what it's like to be excluded, and to be treated as though I'm different, a problem to be fixed. I think when you live your life like that it's hard to not want to change that it's hard to not want to work with other people that you identify with to make fundamental changes that will see people with disabilities included.

And if a person's disability can't be, quote, unquote, \"treated\" they were sent off for care in institutions for really long periods of time. The independent living movement is founded on the rights of people with disabilities to live autonomously and with dignity in their chosen communities."}, {"speaker": "Wendy Porch", "time": "48:18", "text": "In North America, it really started in the 60s and 70s in California. We had a context where people with disabilities were largely shut away. So there was an expectation that you were not going to be part of the community, you're not going to have a job, you're not going to go to school. And you were supposed to be okay with that, too. Ed Roberts is largely seen as being the founder of the Independent Living Movement. When he was 14 years old, he developed polio and he was basically paralyzed overnight. Well, he went from a kid who was doing all of the things to being a young man who now was paralyzed, but didn't change. And really, you know, what, what we all have in common is the desire for accomplishments and for connection and to go out and build a life for himself. He fought to be able to go to the University of California, they didn't want to let him in. He used an iron lung quite a lot of the time, they didn't want to let him in. And they said your iron legs too big for our dorm rooms, you can't live in residence. But they eventually came up with a space for him to live in the hospital, on campus where he moved in. And then other disabled folks fought for the same rights. They fought for the same opportunities as Ed had to be able to live in this hospital, in fact, but away from home for the first time for many of them to go to school with the support they needed. So out of that really early accomplishment, they built the first independent living center in California. And this is where people with disabilities as we were talking about before the care model came from this movement centers expertise in the person with a disability so when real person themselves and that was a radical shift in where expertise lies. That's where the movement started. And alongside it came this academic movement around critical disability studies. But it just wanted to say that this was not just a context that existed in the US. Here in Canada just 40 years ago, we had young disabled people living in hospitals as well, for many years what's now known as Bloorview Kids Rehab hospital. For many years, that hospital was known as the home for incurable children. The were no community supports. Kids with disabilities lived there, the previous and the founding executive director of CILT, Sandra Carpenter, who we sadly lost earlier this year. But who was a great mentor to me and a great friend of both Karen and I, she and her sister lived at the hospital. That's where they lived for many years, that was their home. And a number of other kids lived there too. And there were stories about the hospital administrators trying to make the kids who lived there year round, were hospital bracelets, the kids sort of rebelling against that and moving away from it and really trying to carve out a space for life. And of course, when those kids aged out or view, the expectation was that they were going to live in long term care facilities that was going to be good enough to they didn't want that they fought and they work together and connected. And they made different options for themselves. The direct funding program is built by people who did not want to live in long term care, as was the incentive for Independent Living in Toronto, for example."}, {"speaker": "James Saravanamuttu", "time": "51:11", "text": "We just heard some really amazing initiatives from Alex and Wendy.

Try it out, you might love it, you might find out that it actually is not such a big deal. I think that ultimately, we need to open ourselves up to the idea that we often have a very narrow understanding of sexuality, a very narrow understanding of sexual attraction, a very narrow understanding of what are to be proper, successful, good, strong, romantic relationships. I guess the other things that they should know is that disabled people are absolutely sexual, there are some disabled people who may not be able to reproduce. But there are many, many, many, many, many disabled people that are. You can have a child with a disabled person, it doesn't necessarily mean that that child be disabled. And maybe it would be okay if they were as well. But a big part of that was about me embracing myself first. I think a big part of it was me becoming comfortable. And eventually pride and pride's not for everybody, eventually proud of the person that I am proud of my difference, comfortable in my own skin, as they say, and I did that self acceptance piece is often a really important first step toward other people then accepting you as well, that your comfort and your confidence, I think, in my experience, actually goes a really long way in terms of people not seeing you just as quote unquote, \"a disabled person\". I think in all dating, you got to bring something to the table, you have to be valuable in some way. And often for a lot of people that having someone who's confident, fun, nice, in many ways, that's often enough to form some really good worthwhile relationships. Yeah, embrace your difference. Embrace your disabled self, and know that there are people that will look beyond it, that won't just see the biomedical side of you that it might be hard might be a long journey. But it's possible.

I think that's really, really important to understand. First of all, I think that is why Liz and I focus so heavily on this cultural and identity based perspective. Disability, your experience of disability as a chronically ill versus a non chronically ill person is very different. Experience of disability, if you're a black or indigenous person are very different than you know, myself as a white disabled person. So that's really, really important. Disabled identity is shaped by so many other sort of intersections of embodied and socio economic and racial experience. And for people who have disabilities that are medically visible that are acknowledged by the clinic, they're often denied agency over their own bodies, and it's anticipated that they have an inherently diminished quality of life just simply by virtue of living in an atypical body or mind. Their experience of being denied authority over their embodied experiences is that they're told that their body is unworthy that they're capable of so much less than they are. And I think it's interesting because there's that untold or less whole history of medically invisible disability. We have sort of the opposite problem, which is that we are told we can do so much more than we can. And when we assert that we cannot do something, we're told, you just need to have more willpower, you just need to be more disciplined. And fundamentally, it's the same problem, it's that our experiences of our body are being denied by those outside of us. And it teaches us that we don't have the authority, we don't have the agency to name what's happening in our own bodies. I think recognizing that a there's this dual history and it's not a clean break, not all disabilities are purely sort of defined by this experience of visibility. And not all of them are purely defined, as defined by this experience of invisibility, there are fluctuations of a wheelchair. So when people see me in a wheelchair, they perceive me very differently than when they see me walking with a cane. For example, there's fluctuation. Recognizing these two different dynamics that sort of exist where on the one hand, you're denied agency over your body, you're denied independence, and on the other your embodied experiences are denied and you're told that you just lack willpower and discipline is really important, and recognizing that they both come from a place of not affording people power to name their own embodied experiences and perceptions."}, {"speaker": "Wendy Porch", "time": "56:04", "text": "I think it's the system.

The idea that there could be a disabled parent is not one that's commonly out there. I think in terms of the training that folks like yourself, get. I think that that's another reason why these sorts of partnerships that we have with Karen and with other researchers are so important because we need to broaden this narrative, you need to be able to know that people with disabilities can be anywhere, we're everywhere, same way 22% of the population, when we start to recognize that and start to build that into the way that we think about, for example, medical training, who is a parent potentially, who goes where then we will start to dismantle these kinds of ablest structures that have kept us out of those spaces for so long."}, {"speaker": "Seth Kibel", "time": "57:12", "text": "A very special thanks to our guests, Alex Haagaar, Dr. Jeff Preston, Wendy Porch, and Dr. Karen Yoshida for speaking with us and sharing all of their insights.

But one needs to understand that dialysis treatment only offers about 10% or so of kidney function. So obviously it is not a perfect treatment and this compares to anywhere between 35-40 to 100% of normal kidney function that is being provided by a successful kidney transplant. The different types of kidney transplant or transplant can be broadly categorized as the deceased donor and living donor transplants. And there are additional categories within the deceased donor transplant as well. If we talk about the deceased donor transplant first, in Ontario, this is organized provincially, the Trillium Gift of Life Network coordinates deceased donor transplantation. So if you have end stage kidney failure, and you need a transplant, eventually you need to get on a waiting list for a deceased donor transplant because there is not enough donors to provide a kidney transplant immediately for people who require the transplant at any time, so you will have to go on a waiting list and this waiting list and the whole transplant and donation process is coordinated by Trillium Gift of Life network."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "5:59", "text": "To get further insight about the process of gaining access to a transplant in Canada, as well as the complex bioethical and policy dimensions of organ donation, we spoke to Jed Gross, Bioethicist with the University Health Network, and a member of the Joint Centre for Bioethics at the University of Toronto."}, {"speaker": "Jed Gross", "time": "6:16", "text": "I'm most familiar with the process in Ontario, so I'll use that as an illustration. In general, patients who are experiencing organ failure will be referred by a physician in the community to a transplant center for assessment. If the patient is potentially someone who will benefit from a transplant, a multidisciplinary team will do a thorough medical workup through a series of appointments and then come together to make a listing decision based on whether the transplant candidate meets provincial criteria. To the extent that we're able to work with the patient to line up pieces that seem iffy like if the patient would benefit from better access to mental health resources. It's important that we consider the individual's likelihood of benefiting from transplan=t with these supports in place. If a patient is found ineligible for listing, they can go to another Transplant Center for a second opinion.

Practically speaking that during our life for various reasons, we might our immune system might build some antibodies that may respond or may attack the antigens of another person if we encounter their antigens. And of course, with a transplant when you're receiving an organ from someone else, you're getting proteins and antigens from that other person. If you have preformed antibodies in your blood, your immune system will attack that organ immediately, and will lead to rejection and that's the other level of matching."}, {"speaker": "Noor Al Kaabi", "time": "8:36", "text": "We also asked Dr. Mucsi about how long patients wait to receive a transplant."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Istvan Mucsi", "time": "8:41", "text": "On average, waiting time can vary between a few months to six to eight to ten years after starting dialysis. Ideally, when you are developing chronic kidney disease and kidney failure, you should start thinking about the different renal replacement therapies whether you want to explore transplant or whether you want to just stick to dialysis, weigh the pros and cons for those. For many patients, the best way to get a transplant is before they start dialysis actually. It's called pre-emptive transplant, and this is when you get the kidney transplant even before your kidney function is below the level that necessitates a renal replacement therapy. In general, we measure kidney function from blood work associated number or prioritize the kidney function with a number it's called glomerular filtration rate or GFR. For kind of sake of ease, we talk about percentages. You may not feel any symptoms until your kidney function is as low as 30% or so. But if you have chronic kidney disease from various reasons, it may take you 5, 10, 20 years to get down to this range of 30 to 40%, when you start feeling symptoms of the medicines, you will need renal replacement therapy because of the symptoms and because of the severity of the condition once your kidney function is below about 10% or so, and you can go on the waiting list, once your kidney function is about 15% of normal. The clock doesn't start ticking for you until you start dialysis. The only way to get this pre-emptive transplant is to get a living donor transplant. If you want the living donor transplant, unfortunately, the onus is on you to find a donor or your family or friends.

And my brothers come in the waiting room with all these bags because they were boxing day shopping. So that experience it was stressful, but it brought everyone closer together. I was in the hospital for a week after. And then I think recovery was probably the hardest part for me. So actually going through surgery and being in the hospital, I don't think that was as hard as everything I came after. I've always been someone who's always busy and for me to just take a step back and not do anything that really got to me because I had never done that before.

And then as for the other two, I guess you hope not run into transplant rejection but it is something that does occur among different patients. I ended up with chronic rejection of the lungs, and then once more after that transplant. Lungs are a little harder to come by and the waitlist, say in 2014 was six months to a year. But you know, we've had cases that are two years plus - long story short, it was four months waiting on the list, which is less than the initial six months to a year expectation. That was nice and getting the call is truly like there's no feeling like it. Like \"Wow, I'm gonna get a lung transplant, I'm gonna know what it's like to be like a normal person\".

Transplant emphasis often frameless as a balance between equality of access and utility. There's a threshold for listing patients of about a 50% anticipated five year survival post-transplant in Ontario. Among that population, the available organs are allocated algorithmically. So at this point, it shifts from a committee making a listing determination to something that is more like numbers being called in a lottery in some sense although those numbers reflect biomedical criteria. Patients who have the most dire need while falling within the group that are likely to benefit tend to be prioritized, but a lot of the contours are diagnosis specific or differences, like how important immunological matching is to avoid rejection of the transplanted organ. With kidneys, Canadian Blood Services has a national program for getting organs to patients who are especially hard to match. In addition to these accommodations of relevant differences, if we shift focus and look at living donation, we accept that many individuals are donating to help a specific loved one. And we accept that as a kind of appropriate partiality. To the extent that we deviate from utilitarian norms like trying to approximately equalize wait times for kidneys or the risk of death on the waitlist for vital organs. It's really a matching exercise occurring at a policy level. Certainly the size of the benefit relative to the alternative of not getting a transplant factors very warmly in this."}, {"speaker": "Atefeh Mohammadi", "time": "16:45", "text": "Many papers have appeared in recent years maintaining that women, the elderly, people with disabilities, racialized people, and other marginalized groups do not receive transplants to the extent that they could and should be.

For example, when the United States retooled its liver allocation system to emphasize disease acuity, as measured by something called meld score, research showed that significant racial disparities adversely impacting Black Americans were largely alleviated, but gender disparities adversely affecting women actually became worse. This is probably related to differences in muscle mass and serum creatinine levels, there's generally no requirement that we use this specific criterion like that, and if it significantly disadvantages that particular group of patients, that may be a reason to revise or abandon the criteria. Importantly, a difference in access that correlates with a highly studied social category may actually draw attention to a problem that causally maps on to something else. For example, if higher waitlist mortality among women is a result of unnecessary size matching. That disadvantages physically smaller candidates, the gender lens is an illuminating starting point, but addressing the problem in an appropriately targeted way, may entail revisiting the size criteria regardless of a patient's gender, or ethnicity or diagnosis or other considerations. I think the key is to look at each stage in the process carefully to identify patterns of inequality that may be inconsistent with the values underpinning allocation from referral to listing criteria, to transplant and mortality data. If there's a disparity, is there an addressable cause? It could be that one population is unfairly disadvantaged at the referral stage, but among this population, those who are listed are getting a priority that then seems unwarranted based on waitlist mortality data. I actually recently joined a group of researchers based in Toronto led by Hollom Awadhi, that proposes to do this kind of staged breakout of data using available data from the Institute for clinical and evaluative sciences or ICES. Finally, I should note that like the COVID-19 epidemic, transplant medicine provides a kind of window on societal inequities. If we start peeling back the layers of the onion and find that some patients have poorer access to living donation, because their friends and family are economically marginalized or in precarious health themselves, this may be a social justice concern that impacts transplant outcomes.

So while in many of the efforts that are focusing on improving access for living donor transplant, we try to focus on helping patients who have kidney failure to communicate with others to help them. I think it is very important that we also need to talk to the general community, because it makes things tremendously easier for everybody.

You know, I was a third year medical student when I heard on the radio that surgeons at Toronto General had done the first successful lung transplant in the world. And you know, I mean, it had been tried 43 times before and failed. So, you know, when they took that patient into the operating room, in 1983, no one had ever survived that operation. So, it was remarkable as an achievement. And you know, as a medical student, it was sort of noteworthy for me because I never heard of a lung transplant I'd heard of kidney and liver, right and heart. So it was kind of, you know I thought, \"Oh, that's pretty cool that they can transplant lungs\". And that kind of that was it. And then, you know, I finished medical school and then I started my surgical residency and I was assigned to the thoracic surgery service. And lo and behold, they were doing the first double lung transplant in the world when I was on call that night. So I got to scrub in and assist and witness that happening. And it was just an amazing miracle but also quite an impression on me and in how risky it was, how unpredictable preservation was at the time, and what an incredible feat it was to even pull it off one at a time. And at that time, we quoted a 50 percent mortality of the operation to the patients, which was just amazing. And today, a patient going into our operating room tonight, basis a 1.5%, mortality, you know, like a 98.5% chance of surviving the operation that was 50/50 when I was a medical student, or less. So, you know, we've come a long way. The first was in developing stable preservation techniques. The low potassium dextran solution that was my master's thesis work has really become the standard of lung preservation worldwide now. It's marketed and available for all programs around the world. And then we took the next step and say, okay, we don't just want to preserve the lung the way we found it, but can we make it better than we found it? Can we make the lung that's ready for that transplant challenge."}, {"speaker": "Noor Al Kaabi", "time": "25:56", "text": "We also asked Dr. Keshavjee, about what makes some organs more challenging to transplant versus others."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shafique Keshavjee", "time": "26:02", "text": "Some of it is the vulnerability of the organ and the way they're built, you know, a kidney is relatively robust, as is a liver. The heart is a little more finicky, and limited in how long it'll go without blood flow. And the lung is is interesting, because lung tissue starts to die in about 20 seconds. But one of the things we realized which was key to our preservation technique, and the technological advance, is that you can fill the lung with oxygen. And even though it doesn't have blood flow, it can get oxygen to all its cells by diffusion, direct diffusion. So even though it's ischemic, meaning no blood flow, it's not anoxic. And we took advantage of that. So we fill the lungs with oxygen when we store them. So they have a supply and use it that way. But these are the kinds of things that you have to figure out, like what is specific for each organ? How can you help that organ in that stressed state. You know, the easiest transplant really is a kidney transplant, right? Because also, if the kidney doesn't work, you got dialysis as a backup. A heart transplant actually is very simple to do. It's very straightforward, right, switching out a pump. A kidney and heart were the first two transplants to be achieved. And then liver, you know, came afterwards. And lung transplant, like the first kidney transplant was done in the 50s and the first successful lung transplant didn't happen until 1983. Not for lack of trying, it is actually the hardest of the transplants to do, because of that issue of the blood supply. The lung is a very, very fragile organ, I mean, feels like a very soft sponge. And and you know, the lung, if you look at it microscopically, the walls are just two cells thick, okay with the blood vessel and their lung cell on each side. And so you know, that that is very fragile, and vulnerable to damage and requires preservation. Now, the trick we did of saying, well, let's just keep the oxygen in it so that the cells don't get starved of oxygen was really a homerun that, that allowed us to leapfrog the other organs that were 25 years ahead of us. And now lung, in terms of the unique advanced things that you can do with an organ, we've been able to do more of that. And now you know, the liver and the heart and the kidney people are, you know, sort of understanding that you can really, you know, change this and modify organs and improve them with some of these techniques. So, ex vivo liver is certainly, you know, was the next one to be developed in England, and then people heart now is coming along. And"}, {"speaker": "Atefeh Mohammadi", "time": "28:49", "text": "A lot of Dr. Keshavjee's work has focused on ways to alter donor lungs to improve lung function and prevent organ rejection, effectively increasing the viable organ supply. His lab is currently exploring the use of gene therapy to alter donor lungs and make them better suited for transplant."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shafique Keshavjee", "time": "29:06", "text": "When you die, you're not going to use those organs. But you could save eight, nine lives by, you know, agreeing to be an organ donor. But when you take it one step further, those organs have a history and some damage to them. They may not be perfect. And then the recipient spends the rest of their lives trying to reject that organ and destroy it because it's not self. So once we got going with organ transplantation, I realized that if you could use the opportunity to say well, can you modify the organ so it looks more like self before self gets to see it? then maybe you give that organ a better chance and and have better outcomes in transplant. So, very early on, we moved the research from preservation, to actually modification of organs or improving organs to have a better chance for transplant. So, ultimately our goal is can you make an organ that will outlive or outlast the recipient? So initially, we have started with really proving the concept that you can do it, right. So we initially started working in the donor, and we did animal studies and so on, showing that you could transduce the lung in the donor, and then have the gene expressed after transplant, and then have the gene actually improve the outcome after transplant. And what we did is we took the common cold virus adenovirus took out the viral genes and put in interleukin 10 gene. And interleukin 10 is a cytokine that downregulates inflammation in the innate immune response of reperfusion injury related to the transplant, and also downregulates the acquired immune response or the rejection response. So it's kind of a very good place to start, you need a huge burst of IL-10, at the beginning to downregulate all that acute injury, and then a low level of IL-10 forever in the organ to prevent rejection. So when the T cells come down through the organ, and they would be turned off, if you will, or turn down. The really important concept of that, too, is right now the way we immunosuppress transplant recipients is we give them drugs that suppress the whole immune system. Right. And so they're more vulnerable to infections, they're more vulnerable to developing cancer. So if we could just, even at the simplest concept, create local immunosuppression with gene therapy, then you would spare systemic immunosuppression, and all the complications of that. So that would be the moderate g oal, and that the sort of home run goal is not eating any immunosuppression."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "31:57", "text": "We asked Dr. Keshavjee about the bigger picture. How does his research change the reality of patients waiting for a lung?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shafique Keshavjee", "time": "32:03", "text": "We find, you know, lungs with big blood clots and pulmonary emboli. Sometimes even the patient died of a pulmonary embolus. And you say, how could you use a lung like that? Well, we wouldn't. But when we put it on the ex-vivo, we would put it on the system, we would treat it with drugs to break down clots like we treat humans, patients that that have a big blood clot to their lung, dissolve the clot and assess the lung function and show that the lung is still good. If it didn't get better, don't use it, if it's better use it. So that's a simple one. Another one is a lot of lungs have a lot of fluid in them. With severe brain injury, you get what's called neurogenic, pulmonary edema, related to the brain dysfunction, fluid leaks into the lungs, and so the oxygen goes down, and the lungs aren't working well, that actually is a reversible injury, If only you knew that, that's all that was going on. So when you take the lungs out of the donor, put them on the ex vivo system perfused them with a fluid to suck out the fluid out of the lung, and the lung keeps getting better and better, you're confident to use it. Many donor lungs are also infected with hepatitis C. These are young donors with good lungs, except they're infected with hepatitis C. And now there are drugs to treat hepatitis C. We're developing a system to sterilize the lungs with UVC light, so that you can actually kill the viral particles and not have the hepatitis C transplanted into the recipient. So these are the kinds of things that you can take lungs that we never would use and make them usable. It has had a tremendous effect in the sense that worldwide of all the multi organ donors that are available, only one in five lungs are used, four out of five are not used. And that's North American numbers. It's even smaller and some continents. So can we improve that number. And in our institution, we fully doubled the number of transplants we perform per year. We're, you know, the largest lung transplant program in the world, by virtue of being able to use more lungs."}, {"speaker": "Noor Al Kaabi", "time": "34:18", "text": "Dr. Keshavjee shared the highlights of his very challenging job that makes the tough and sometimes very long days worth it."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shafique Keshavjee", "time": "34:25", "text": "Oh, it's a fantastic thing, that your job really helps people and you save lives. It's tough, you don't always win. So you have to sort of be able to take that part of it. But also to see that you know, what you do can impact not only your patient, but patients around the world by what you show people what you're doing. But the really exciting part about that is, you know, when you find a problem that seems insurmountable, you go to the lab and study it and figure out a new way to do things and bring that clinically and make a difference again, like we did with the low potassium dextrans solution, like we did with ex vivo lung perfusion, like we did with the Nova lung and artificial lung techniques. Now, the ex vivo lung work, we've adopted that to do in vivo lung perfusion, to treat cancer in the lung without sending the chemotherapy around the body. So in other words, treat just the lung with the high dose chemotherapy. So you don't cause toxicity to the kidney, or liver, or the eyes. So I mean, that's really exciting to continue to be able to innovate, and bring, bring these things that change, medicine and change the chance that people will live. I mean, I met a lady the other day who had a lung transplant 29 years ago, like she should have been dead in six months, 29 years ago. Lived her whole life worked, had children, grandchildren, people being married everything when she would not have been there at all, right. And even today, we have patients like that that are in danger of dying any day now. And we can snatch him off the edge and help them and get them to a meaningful and productive life. So that's a pretty exciting part."}, {"speaker": "Atefeh Mohammadi", "time": "36:23", "text": "It's clear that organ transplant surgery is incredibly serious and a support system is crucial. We had the chance to speak with Jillian Lynch, Myles' sister. She has been a caregiver for her brother through all these years and a passionate advocate for organ donation. "}, {"speaker": "Jillian Lynch", "time": "36:39", "text": "So the way that Myles told me about his first double lung transplant, that he'd gotten the call. He called me and he said, like, \"hey, do you want to see me one last time before I get new lungs?\" and I literally start shaking, I like burst into tears. And I'm, I'm, you know, really dramatically like, yelling out, \"My brother is gonna get a double lung transplant! He's gonna live!\" And everyone in that space ran up and gave me this huge hug. And people are just throwing snacks into my hands to like, take with me and I, I was so new to Toronto, so new to York University, so new to everything. So I still hadn't figured out how to use the bus. So I'm like yelling at people and all night Myles and I like told her favorite stories, from the memories that we've made together and then waited for him to roll into transplant. You know, in some ways, for Myles, it was a really precious moment. But I was also scared because there's a chance that this could be the last moment I have with Myles because at SickKids, that's something that they prepared the family members for - was that, you know, you have to realize that transplants amazing, but it can also be your last moment with them. It's like the moments right before they roll into surgery because there's not that 100% guarantee. So I think that that moment, just really triggering a few moments that we had for certain before Myles rolled into surgery was really special for me as a sister. And before each transplant Myles was rolled into I think you're really just appreciating who they are as a person. And I know from Myles' third transplant, I thought for sure that he wasn't going to come out of that one at all, I didn't know that he was gonna come out. And we were really, I think saying goodbye to each other in those few hours that we knew that we had before he was rolled into surgery. So I think transplant is such an emotional experience because it can really be life saving and life changing and like give you an opportunity to live a totally different life if your recovery goes well, but there is also the reality that it could be the last moment with your loved one."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "38:48", "text": "An organ transplant can be a lifeline.

It's not as easy as some people think after transplant. A lot of people think transplant is a cure but just a method of treatment.

And then after, I just felt so much healthier, I started going to the gym regularly I started doing, being more active and living a healthier lifestyle. Because like I said, before I was working a lot, I was just burning out.

That's, that's a crummy part. If you're in chronic rejection, at like the end of the first set of lungs or the end of the second, you still experience breathlessness and loss of energy, things like that. But at least it's still a clear set of lungs that have good air exchange, it's just that they're they're functioning at a less quality, I guess you could say, but with CF lungs, it's tremendously congested with the phlegm and mucus. See, you always kind of sounded sick, I still yeah, I live it up pretty good. I lived a good life and the quality of life I've had after transplant, regardless of immediately after recovery stage or, or in the nice honeymoon stage, or even in chronic rejection, I still had a good time."}, {"speaker": "Atefeh Mohammadi", "time": "41:27", "text": "All transplant surgeries come with the risk of organ rejection.

What can we do? And like there's really nothing you can really, really do. So you're on anti-rejection medication and maybe I'll just say for it works out very well for for most transplant patients I'm just kind of the anomaly. Although, you know, some do get transplant rejection, I seem to reject the organs quite quickly. So in a in that sense, the first time you go through transplant rejection it's like confusing, upsetting, it's happening so quickly, how come we can't treat this? So at times, you're frustrated, and then you decide to let it go."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "42:55", "text": "We asked Myles about how his experience changed with each transplant surgery,"}, {"speaker": "Myles Lynch", "time": "43:00", "text": "Every transplant is a little more difficult in the sense. The second one was five hours long surgery. And then as far as personally recovering from the second one, that one was the toughest of the three. That one was a lot . It was kind of like every hurdle I ran into. CMV, cytomegalovirus I needed plasmapheresis because the antibodies are reacting to the lungs too much. Yeah, they had to remove the antigens or something like that. A lot of costochondritis episodes, just in general, more pain. Yeah. And the second one was really quite a struggle. As far as the recovery standpoint, went it was a lot more than I was prepared for since I kind of figured, \"Oh I went through this before. It'll be a lot to go through, but I'm kind of ready for it,\" but it was a lot more than it's prepared for. So when it came to the third one was probably that much more nervous. But actually, as far as the surgery went, the I guess there was a lot of difficulty for the doctors. So it was 21 hours in surgery till they had to stop the operation. So I needed a few days simply rest, which I believe was because of my hemoglobin was too low, then back into surgery for another few hours, removed some clots, some other stuff I can't quite remember and then finally stapled closed. So it kind of sounded like it would be much more difficult recovery. But I'd say the third one was actually the easiest to recover from, which is kind of interesting."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "44:51", "text": "Myles is the first Canadian to have received three double lung transplants.

And as we alluded to, in the introduction, many are working to try to improve efficiency in the system. One potential shift, which we often hear discussed is the move away from an opt in, or encouraged volunteerism system towards an opt out, or default donation system."}, {"speaker": "Jed Gross", "time": "46:09", "text": "In North America generally has an opt in approach where in order to be an organ donor in the event that an individual dies in a way that their organs are usable, they have to authorize it either by registering, for example online or when they're renewing their driver's license or through proxy communication by the next of kin, stating that this is what that individual would have wanted. Up down kind of shifts the default rule so that those individuals who have an objection to donation, they're the responsibility for registering that objection in some way. It can be implemented in a variety of ways. So hard opt out policies might require that individuals register in a database to opt out other societies may have introduced opt out and continue to in practice defer to the wishes of the family at the bedside. Although the term consent is commonly used for both living and deceased donation, I prefer to distinguish between permission for deceased donation and the kind of robust informed consent that's needed before we would subject a living donor to the risks associated with surgery. Anyone who's considering a major elective procedure must be informed of the nature of the surgery, potential benefits and complications. An important safeguard here, whether two potential patients, the donor and recipient is having separate clinical teams focused on each of those individuals to ensure that each patient is getting the clinicians undivided loyalty. On the deceased donation side, some scholars have advocated shifting from an opt in approach to registration to an opt out approach. Advocates of opt out cite different rationales one is that this approach better reflects what people would want to do anyway, while other arguments highlight reflect a heightened commitment to saving lives on a societal level."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "48:15", "text": "It does seem that there's a lot of a lot of just deferring to the wishes of the family at the bedside over over everything. Would that be accurate? "}, {"speaker": "Jed Gross", "time": "48:24", "text": "I think that's what happens in practice and it's hard to justify philosophically. If you believe that we have a fairly broad right to make decisions about the disposition of our own bodies after death, for example, I might prefer to be cremated rather than burried, which may be the tradition in my family, it seems that this would include the decision to donate organs and tissue for therapy research. The problem is actually enforcing that in a way that is seen as respectful by the living relatives who are mourning a loss. I think that one way of addressing this would be to promote better communication between individuals who are interested in organ donation and friends and family who may actually be there in the event that something tragic happens. Another option would be to actually try to in some way, enforce this through legal means more rigorously, which then does risk potentially touching on sensitive issues of public trust. I think that some of the instances where opt out has been introduced successfully, it fit well with the political culture. It may have been a country where there was a long history of performing autopsies on all patients who died in hospital for example. The circumstances in which patients are actually passing away may be very different from one society to another, whether we're talking about a place that has a high rate of vehicular accidents or somewhere where we're primarily looking at patients who are dying in hospital. All of these considerations would seem to affect how this will actually play out. I think that in the type of complex, diverse society that we have in Ontario, this is something where we would want to proceed very slowly if we were to go ahead with really extensive public consultation and then a campaign to ensure that the public is informed before the switch would actually occur."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "50:34", "text": "So if not a shift to an opt out system, what other policies could be or have been implemented to incentivize organ donation."}, {"speaker": "Jed Gross", "time": "50:44", "text": "Well on the living donation side rather than incentives most of us who support living donation prefer to talk about removing disincentives. If a patient is a friend or family member, or a more distant  in social relation who is interested in donation, but needs to take time off work and travel to a major city for appointments, can we make sure that donating will leave them no worse off economically? Right now, the approach to this kind of problem seems a little piecemeal in Canada based on economic need and where a person lives. The Netherlands has been held out as a model of a more comprehensive approach. I'm not the most familiar person, but there is a an ethicist named as Segreed Fry Revure in the states who has done a lot of work trying to figure out ways of supporting living donors. And when she looked at the Dutch model, she looked at issues like prohibitions on insurance discrimination subsequent to donating systems that were in place to essentially guarantee that people would receive compensation for lost wages from work."}, {"speaker": "Myles Lynch", "time": "51:53", "text": "I do try and advocate as much as possible for organ donation in general, and then even further for an opt out system.

So at that point, I didn't really feel like I needed her. But once I got out, and once I was in recovery, they were really great. And they set me up with a social worker, and a psychiatrist so I was able to talk to them and sort of explain my experience and they have specific psychiatrists and social workers for transplant, which I really liked because not everyone's gonna understand what you went through, but at least with transplant patients, we have stuff in common and some of our stories are similar. So they've sort of dealt with similar stories so they know how to deal with my story. So I was it was really helpful for me.

And we had all kinds of nurses that would come in with special jokes, kind of sneaky smoothies or something or like good snacks. So going from that to the adult system where it's just so different. And I think it's a hard transition. And I know that I'm echoing the thoughts of so many people I've talked to that have made the same transition either as as a patient or as a caregiver or as a family member.

And what that is, is when an infection gets into your bones, and causes your bone to soften and break away eventually. Now I've been dealing with osteomyelitis for about 14, 15 years prior to my amputation. We continued to save the legs and the limbs because as the medical community know, you try to save the limb as much as you can to make sure that the person can still have use of the lump. In my case, however, we'd exhausted all opportunities to save the limb through continuous IVs, antibiotics, pain medication, and all of that. As a runner at the time, I couldn't really do anything that would keep me active. I was left a lot of times, just on the couch vegging because I'm been too much being to actually even walk my dog two blocks. So in 2016, around the fall of 2016, after having coming back to Canada as an expat, I had complained to my doctor that while I was away, I had a lot of bouts with an infection on my limb, that he took a look at it, and he said, What do you want to do now? Because we can chip away at the bone again and go on 10 days of antibiotics, and that's pretty much where we're at with this. And I said no, I think it's best to move forward and just have an amputation. And he said, Are you sure? Because this is a no turning back. Right. We've worked on 15 years of trying to save the limb. And I said no, I think I want to have this done. Now I think I'm done with what it looks like 15 years ago. And so he said well, I would like to get you to have a second opinion. So I went and had a second opinion with another doctor, and he said I think for a better quality of life, you're a great candidate for having an amputation. You're still fairly young, and we can go ahead with it. So January 10, 2017. I had my left below knee amputation. Right off the bat, I didn't think of my amputation at all as a disability.

In Canada, probably over 80% of amputations are occurring and people that have diabetes. And diabetes is also a risk factor for vascular disease. So we call those type of amputations, disvascular amputations, and they really result from complications of diabetes and or vascular disease. And these are patients that might have wounds on their feet that don't heal, or pain because they have blockages in their blood vessels to their feet or their legs, and that leads them to have amputations. Some people get really sick, so they might get a blood infection and they need to have the amputation to sort of control the infection and make sure that they recover. The next leading cause of amputations in North America is trauma. And that could be anything from a motor vehicle collision or workplace accident, or sporting accident. And then the third leading cause is cancer. And that would be like a sarcoma when we think of Terry Fox, he had the most common sort of type of cancer that leads to an amputation. Other patients may lose their limbs because of metastatic spread, so maybe a skin cancer that went to the bone or a kidney cancer that ended up going to the bone. So, so really, you're just amputating to get rid of the cancer so that the patients can survive and get on with their lives or the bony spread can cause a lot of pain and patients have amputation for pain management as well."}, {"speaker": "Jason Lo Hog Tian", "time": "5:56", "text": "We asked Dr. Mayo, what considerations go into deciding what level of amputation is right for a patient."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Amanda Mayo", "time": "6:02", "text": "There's multiple levels of amputation, and then we have sort of terms that we use, but both for the arms and the legs, or upper extremities and lower extremities. Sometimes it's because, it's due to the degree of infection or the amount of tissue that's involved. And so it was a patient and surgeon sort of talking together to see what the best level will be, so that it heals, particularly with our diabetic patients have vascular disease, sometimes we have to go with a higher level amputation just so that the the wound will heal. It's challenging, though, like for our leg amputations, the higher you go, the harder it is to stand and walk with a prosthesis. So if we can get by with a amputations that's not as high up, it usually leads to better functions for patients after as far as their ability to stand and walk. Some patients will, you know, just look at the whole picture. So we also have patients that maybe they had a foot fracture, and then they had multiple surgeries, for whatever reason, they have an infection of bone or something that's not healing and they might be offered a partial foot amputation, but recognize that there's a lot of good prosthetics that will allow them to run and sort of do more activities if they actually went to a higher up amputation, which would be below the knee. So in the shinbone, so I have a couple of patients that just look at sort of what activities they want to do, and then talk with the prosthetic team and myself to decide, hey, I wouldn't be better suited with a higher amputation, because there's more prosthetic options for me. Or the foot that I have that's remaining is really mal- like has deformities or a lot of pain associated with it, so I'd be better off just amputating the entire foot."}, {"speaker": "Jason Lo Hog Tian", "time": "7:38", "text": "We often hear about what's called phantom limb pain. What exactly is it? And is it common? Are there treatment options available?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Amanda Mayo", "time": "7:46", "text": "Yes, yeah, it's very common. But it's not common to sort of get chronic severe pain long term. That's more small percentage, I would say probably about 10%. But most patients after the surgery will have some element of phantom pain. They could feel like the foot maybe cramping or burning, very different from patient to patient. And I'd say it's still needs to be studied. And some patients won't even have a painful experience, it might be more of symptoms where they can still feel that foot. So we do manage it with pain medications, like nerve pain medications, typically. But there's also other techniques such as mirror therapy, desensitization, deep breathing and sort of mindfulness as well. Because you're sort of you have a new body map, right, so the brain is a little bit plastic. So we can use rehab and other techniques to sort of just let the body know that the limb ends here now. And that can help with sort of phantom pain and symptoms as well."}, {"speaker": "Jason Lo Hog Tian", "time": "8:43", "text": "And we asked Aristotle, who we heard from at the start of the episode about his personal experiences with phantom pain."}, {"speaker": "Aristotle Domingo", "time": "8:49", "text": "I had phantom pain, maybe a week or two after my amputation, In my description of it, it's like broken hot glass, going up and down my leg, from my amputation site, all the way up my leg, through the neck and into your head. So I have had moments while I was still in hospital, where I'll jump out of bed, which then causes more pain because you're still attached to an IV, you're, you're fresh out of surgery, and the shooting, pain comes up you and you jolt out of bed because there's that much pain. So that was expected. And I expected that for the two weeks, for the first two weeks I was in hospital. For both of my surgeries. I was experiencing that kind of pain. And it's funny because my right, two years later was experiencing the exact same thing. So my unique experience is my description of phantom pain is the hot broken glass going up and down my body, font starting from my leg, shooting all the way up to my head. So that's my description of phantom pain. Phantom sensation to me is the sensation of a foot or your limb that is not there. So not associated with pain, but the sensation of your ankle, for example, in my case. I could, and this is gonna sound really funny and probably weird for a lot of people. If I knocked my residual limb on a hard surface of my socket, I could really be, in my brain, tapping my ankle. And when I say that people are like, what am I guess I can tap on the side of my limb, the hard socket, and you'll be just like you tapping your hard ankle bone onto a hard surface. And it's the same sensation it's sending to my brain. To me, that's phantom sensation. Because all our nerves are still at that nerve ending, our brain still thinks that the foot is there, and the ankle is there in my case, right? So I can, I actually do it sometimes when I'm sitting down, is I will do it, just to give my, because I'm bored. And it doesn't bother me. And it doesn't bother me. So I know my foot is out there, I'm aware that my feet aren't there. So when I do it, it's more like, Oh, that's kind of fun. It's a fun feeling. I know, that's a weird thing to say, it's a fun feeling. The same thing with wiggling my toes, all my muscles will still do the same motion as if you wiggle your toes. If you wiggle your toe right now, you can tell your muscles moving from your hip through your calves, right to wiggle your toes. Although they're not there for me, but the same feeling goes down my thighs and my legs, because I thought of it, and now it's giving me the same feedback as if I'm wiggling my toes. So that to me is phantom sensation."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "11:41", "text": "It sounds like whether it's pain or sensation, it's still something that you're experiencing. So how can we work to address it?"}, {"speaker": "Aristotle Domingo", "time": "11:48", "text": "We just need to look at it more uniquely for each individual and say, yeah, this is this is what phantom pain is, you're getting phantom sensation. Here are some exercises you can do to maybe mitigate that. If I get phantom sensation now. I'll get it for like 5, 10 minutes, and I have ways that I do to sort of go, you're not there, I get it. You're itchy right now, but I can't scratch where you are. Right. And so I've done sensation therapy where you train your residual limb or your stump using different like fabrics. Different materials, like fabrics, tea towels, the you know, Velcro stuff like, paper even or a pencil prick to just kind of map out and give your your, your limb different sensations. So it triggers Oh, that's where this is. And that's where that is."}, {"speaker": "Jason Lo Hog Tian", "time": "12:38", "text": "We then asked Aristotle about any challenges he faced immediately following his amputation and with finding the right prosthesis."}, {"speaker": "Aristotle Domingo", "time": "12:45", "text": "So as in a PT after surgery, your your limb would be really big because of your swelling from the trauma you just received from the surgery. So limbs tend to be about eight to 12 months, by standards, or by the book before they have atrophied enough, that you could get a proper fit on your prosthetics. So during that time, the challenge for me anyways, and a lot of people too, is that we get frustrated because we just get fitted with a socket, and then three weeks later, it no longer fits. Or it's painful to wear, right. And then it gets worse when it's three months later, when you really need another one made for you altogether. Because you have to imagine you're starting your limb quite big. And as you atrophy, as your muscle atrophies, it gets smaller and smaller. So your starting point, with your prosthetic with a thermal prep socket, it's plastic, it's heavy plastic, so he can't, you can do a little or the proesthetist can do a little manipulation to that, where they can bend it a little and shape a little, but not enough to actually be supportive of your new size or your new shape. So then they will have to create another one for you. So just it's it's basically that. It's like you want to move on with what you're doing. But because of a non fitting socket, or an ill fitting socket, you can't really do what you want. Right. So for me as an athlete, and as a runner, sometimes I'm stuck on these temporary check sockets, and he shouldn't be running on a temporary check socket, because they could break they're made out of plastic and thermoplastic you put a hard run on that and it will just break apart."}, {"speaker": "Jason Lo Hog Tian", "time": "14:24", "text": "We also spoke to Dr. Jan Andrysek, an engineer and scientist with years of experience designing functional and affordable prostheses."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jan Andrysek", "time": "14:33", "text": "So I'm Jan Andrysek, and I'm a scientist at Holland Bloorview Kids Rehab, which is Canada's largest pediatric rehabilitation hospital.

In terms of the type of research that we do, and and the research is mainly conducted within the bloorview Research Institute within the hospital really looking at trying to develop technologies to improve and better the lives of children with severe disabilities, primarily focusing on physical disabilities, and even if we want to get more specific, a lot of sort of mobility and physical activity type of interventions."}, {"speaker": "Jason Lo Hog Tian", "time": "15:18", "text": "There are many challenges with getting used to a prosthetic. Dr. Andrysek spoke to us about how he uses biofeedback to alert individuals of any problems with their walking."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jan Andrysek", "time": "15:28", "text": "Yeah, so so artificial limb itself is really just just a device, you can think of it as a tool that somebody is prescribed. And really, the effectiveness of the tool is only as good as in the way that it's being used. And so in terms of a prosthesis, we're talking about a lower limb prosthesis, a prosthesis that a person will need to walk on, there is training that's required as the child or the adult is provided this prosthesis, there's training, motor relearning, sort of physiotherapy related gait training that's provided. And that's, really the goal is to try to get the individual to use that prosthesis as effectively as they can, to try to achieve good walking patterns. So they're walking in a pattern that, you know, that that looks sort of typical to what you would sort of expect. And the reason why that's important is not just from the aesthetic point of view. But if those patterns are highly deviated, there can be long term implications in terms of musculoskeletal health, things such as back pain later on in life. And so it's really important that this training is provided. And some of the challenges within the healthcare industry is just delivering this training because it requires individuals to come to the clinic at regular intervals. And so what we're trying to do is using techniques of biofeedback is to augment the type of training that's provided. And our eventual goal is really to try to be able to build into these prostheses, systems that are able to cue the individual using for example haptics, or vibrations, when they are walking with atypical patterns, with less than ideal sort of patterns and trying to encourage them to correct those patterns in a similar fashion as a clinician may dowhen they're trying to train the child. And so really, right now, we're still at the early stages, but we're examining these technologies and trying to make them wearable and usable, and trying to see how well individuals are actually able to respond to the cues that these technologies are providing, and how well are they actually able to improve their walking patterns."}, {"speaker": "Jason Lo Hog Tian", "time": "17:37", "text": "As a scientist at Canada's largest pediatric rehabilitation hospital, we asked Dr Andrysek if there were any significant differences when designing prosthetics for children."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jan Andrysek", "time": "17:47", "text": "I mean, there are certainly challenges in differences when thinking about children. And I mean, first off, they're they're a much smaller group than the typical population with lower limb loss, which tend to be elderly, individuals who just just want to kind of be able to move around and sort of attain limited mobility versus on the other side of the spectrum, you have children who really want to be able to explore and really push themselves in the physical activities that they do, and then to try to keep up with their, with their peers, and compete and all that. So the prosthesis, which is really a tool that the child requires to be able to achieve mobility and to achieve these activities, is really there to help promote and support the child and being able to do these things and fulfill their goals. And so the challenge is really just developing something that's functional, that works well with with the child with their physiology, and, and their anatomy. And second of all, as I mentioned something that's not going to cause them a lot of headaches, something that's going to keep working, despite how they use it, whether they get it wet, whether they get dirt into the device, you know, whether they they're jumping with it, or whatnot. And so, from a practical standpoint, the device just has to be really robust. And functional."}, {"speaker": "Jason Lo Hog Tian", "time": "19:03", "text": "A functional prosthesis is crucially important, especially with children who have an amazing ability to bounce back from injury, and quickly learn how to use it."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jan Andrysek", "time": "19:13", "text": "Generally, yes, and part of it is the brain, which is able to sort of reprogram itself more, it's more plastic. So it's able to reprogram itself more easily and adjust itself to the new new system that the body is comprised of which now includes this prothesis. But children also have, you know, a lot of resilience and they also have a lot of motivation to pursue the things that they want to pursue and to, you know, as I said, to keep up with their peers, so these are real motivators for them to really sort of push the limits of themselves and have the prosthesis in many cases, as that's what we see sort of happening clinically."}, {"speaker": "Jason Lo Hog Tian", "time": "19:51", "text": "We often think of the future of prosthetics as high end robotic limbs, that can give you the agility and strength of a superhero, but the reality is very different."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jan Andrysek", "time": "20:00", "text": "Really, there's a big distinction between what is sort of practical and useful and typically used by individuals, and what we sort of see in the media as state of the art devices, which really are not going to be accessed and obtained by many individuals.

They're very expensive, and many of them are very complicated so they're also very difficult to sort of upkeep and over the long term, really impractical for the normal user, and especially for talking about children, simpler can be better.

And I like to make those sort of comparison to, you know, our cars. You know, a Formula One car might out perform any car that we have here, but in terms of as using it on a daily life.

However, people with prosthesis still face various challenges. Aristotle told us about some of the assumptions and biases he encounters at the individual, environmental and systemic level."}, {"speaker": "Aristotle Domingo", "time": "22:18", "text": "Because I wear shorts, even in the wintertime, the one I get is, Oh, are you diabetic, with a headshaking? Right? They'll give you that look and that face that says, that they've assumed that you've already lost your limbs because of diabetes, the defensive person in me goes, Ah, do you think I'm fat? Or Oh my god, I'm so fat, which I don't think I am. But you do get those. And the funny person inside of me says, No a shark got me and then walk away. Because there are a lot of those assumptions. When people see you on the street, they may not say it, but they will say: 1) because of my age, and what I look like, assumptions are, diabetic, 2) is that I have been in a motorcycle accident, which is very common for limb loss. Interestingly enough, he would even with the likes of Terry Fox being out in mass media, and everybody knows Terry Fox, no one assumes it's cancer. But cancer is one of the most leading causes of amputation, right? There are those barriers that people kind of just assume right away. But then there are physical and systematic barriers that we also go through, when somebody can look at me, and although I am standing on both prosthetic legs, I get the, he's not good enough to do something, because he's from the disabled community, right, or in my wheelchair, systematic and physical barriers, especially if you're in a wheelchair. Our city is not meant to be used by a person in a wheelchair, or walker, or with any mobility aids. Our streets, our sidewalks are often cracked and not leveled. And they're never fixed. We have potholes everywhere. And just the crowds of people using the sidewalks, sometimes don't even look at people coming towards them. When you're in a wheelchair and wheeling down downtown Toronto, you don't have that control to dodge someone who can't see you because they're looking at their phone. Going up a sidewalk, for example, although we say there are ramps, they're not leveled enough that a person can safely put their chair up on the ramp. So there's a lot of those barriers that do happen for us. Compliance is, I would say, not taken seriously. We try hard to be compliant in the city. But it's not, I always say, and there's a loophole around that, is that: we make it compliant; we don't have to make it convenient. So an old building, for example, that says we're compliant, we put a ramp. Well, where's the ramp? Well, it's around the back, going through this dark alley with potholes in it. So then you say, Well, but that's not accessible at all. And they say, Well, it is because we provide a ramp to this building. So there are those challenges, and those are what I call systematic challenges, where people don't think and accessibility is always an afterthought for people, when it comes to design of a building or design of a structure or design of anything, really. But from more, of a systematic [view] in being able to do things, we put a lot culturally to say, that person is disabled, or that person has a disability, they may not be able to do the things that we want them to do, whatever that is, and that's ableism, we already put a stop on those things, even before we speak to the person, you know, we want to find out what they can do. And I've come across those and, and I challenge people sometimes, you're gonna say to me, just because you've seen me with in shorts, but with no legs that I can't do something. I've traveled around the world with an AFO [ankle foot orthosis]. As my job was traveling around the world, I had been on many planes, and traveled to the most remote places in Canada, remote places in the world, and I'm able to do my job. So don't tell me just because of my physical disability, that I can't do, what you're expecting me to do, there are limits to what we can do. Absolutely. Right. I can't lift specific weight, because my prosthetic may not be built that way, for example, to be lifting my body weight and the weight of what I'm carrying. Or I may have issues where my back may be infused along with my amputation where I can't lift those things. But that's for me to tell you and say I can't lift that 50 kilogram weight because my prosthetic cannot lift, 50 kilogram weight. But for you to assume that I can't lift that by looking at me, that's where the barriers [are] and that's where we kind of need to rethink our ways of thinking. When we see somebody with a physical disability, because they are absolutely able, we just had to make sure that things are accessible to us. So we can do the things we want to do. So aside from having this systematic in the perception [challenges], unfortunately, Canada in general is behind in the way, we are providing opportunities for the amputee community to succeed. And what I mean by that is not that we're not providing equipment, we are. Depending on the city, or the province that you're in, for example, here in Ontario. The ADP program, or the assistive device program has not been updated for amputees since 1975. So think about that for a sec. A cost of a candy in 1975 does not equal the cost of the candy today. So that means a prosthetic back in 1975. Both costs and technology does not equal to what the cost of creating one or having one made, in the technology that it is today. So our ADP program here in Ontario says we will cover 75% of the cost. Unfortunately, that is not 75% of an actual cost. Let's say my all time costs for one leg is $10,000. ADP will not cover 75% of that and say we will pay $7500. back on the cost that they figured out in 1975. They should only cover $1500 of that, because the cost of a foot that I should get as a person who lives in Ontario should only be $3,000. So a $3,000 setup would get you a wooden foot or what I would call a World War II foot. It's literally a woodblock. It's literally a woodblock, with a shape, that's shaped like a foot, it has toes in it that's carved out. And then it has a rubber encasing so that you don't slip. And it obviously has a cushion. And so that foot has no ankle dynamic. It's just a wood foot on a pole, or what we call a pylon, and then attached to your socket, which then attaches to you."}, {"speaker": "Jason Lo Hog Tian", "time": "29:15", "text": "As we heard from Aristotle, in addition to the social and physical challenges that an amputee patient faces on a day to day basis, patients in Canada also face the large scale challenge of funding. We asked Dr. Mayo to provide more insight into these funding challenges and gaps, the long term impact of inequitable access, and how our healthcare system can better support patients facing amputation."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Amanda Mayo", "time": "29:40", "text": "The other challenge in Canada is funding. The funding for prosthetics is very variable across Canada. In Ontario, the provincial plan only covers a portion of prosthetic devices. So patients are often faced, you know whether they get a prosthetic or not, but there's a lot of extra costs for equipments and sort of changes to housing, making things more accessible. So even our non prosthetic patients are faced with a lot of financial hardships post amputation, depending on if they have any extra insurance or any extra funding. But the OHIP system does not pay for 100% of a wheelchair. And it also does not pay for 100% of a prosthetic device in Ontario. Some provinces are different in Canada, but in Ontario, it's about 70 to 75%. So microprocessor new units are for patients that have an amputation above the knee, there's actually no funding in the public system in Ontario for microprocessor knee unit. And they have a lot of benefits. And there's been a recent sort of guideline from the states that actually says they're probably frontline for a lot of above knee amputee patients. So I'd like to see maybe the province just look at, and Canada as a whole, look at the advances in prosthetics and change the funding that's available to patients because I think it really is a two tiered system in Canada, where patients that have access to insurance funding maybe from work can get some advanced prosthetics, but patients that maybe only have access to OHIP just have no chance. Because unfortunately, they're very expensive. Some of our knee units are, you know, the price of a luxury vehicle, $80,000 and above, but they allow patients to be more active and and maybe get back to work, maybe get back to activities that they enjoy. So I think when you look at the whole cost on the health care system, it's probably better to have someone more active and being able to work, then perhaps being more sedentary, because they just can't get the prostheses that would allow them to function best. So we're doing a lot of work and sort of looking at the long term outcomes of amputees to see what are the factors that affect people being more isolated or depressed or not able to return to their activities or work and hoping to advocate to get more services and also funding for patients, just so they can live their best life. And I think if they have more ability to participate in physical activities, then it gives them a better chance to sort of recover and and do well long term. So I think, you know, funding and access is where my heart is."}, {"speaker": "Jason Lo Hog Tian", "time": "32:07", "text": "As Aristotle and Dr. Mayo just explained, one of the major funding and accessibility challenges stems from the high cost of prosthetics.

But I really wanted to try to design something that would be simple, but still very effective. And that's sort of the origins of this idea, and this sort of mission I sought out to embark on is to design something that used a very simple technology. And after many attempts and many failures, I eventually managed to come up with a novel mechanism. As the individual is walking, every time they place their weight on the leg, they need to feel assured, and be confident that that leg is going to be underneath them. And so we developed mechanism that that was able to do that. And it was a very simple mechanism. And right from the get go this mechanism that was intended for kids, which as I mentioned earlier, we need something simple and robust, something that's not going to break. And so after, you know many years of development, we were able to develop this technology into a product which I was able to we were able to through a startup company start to bring it to to the people who need it and right now the technology is available in about 40 countries and about 20 of those are low and middle income countries. So while we have developed, I believe is a good technology and a good technology that that's applicable to low middle income countries. There are other challenges, as I sort of learned going down this sort of mission. You know, and and really the challenges relate to the delivery and the and the healthcare systems that are in place that would even allow access to to some of the prosthetic devices. So the issues such as lack of trained individuals to take the technology and properly apply it to the patient. Even even at the much reduced cost that we're able to provide this technology, even that, in many, many places is still unattainable just because of the poverty levels that exist."}, {"speaker": "Jason Lo Hog Tian", "time": "35:11", "text": "Dr. Andrysek and Aristotle ended with a call to action that invites people from all backgrounds to come up with solutions to the global health problem of delivering functional prosthetics to those who need it."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jan Andrysek", "time": "35:23", "text": "Yeah, I mean, if you're listening, and you don't have to be an engineer.

And some of the challenges are in getting the technology to the people who need it, or even just developing the clinical evidence to figure out what technology works best for what individuals. So part of my job these days is not so much sitting there and designing prosthesis, but really trying to mentor and support students and trainees to really open their minds and motivate them and hopefully, to some degree, inspire them to to try to come up with with solutions, both from the technical side, but also developing the clinical evidence, as I mentioned. And even from the business side, figuring out how do you make it viable to provide, what are still fairly expensive, even though you're talking about hundreds of dollars, as opposed to hundreds of thousands, even hundreds of dollars can be too much for somebody living in a poor country to afford, and so how do you make a business model that would allow the provision of these devices to poorer countries? How do you make that possible?

When I left the hospital, I felt only normal when I'm in rehab, when I'm doing my outpatient. I wasn't seeing amputees out in the community. And I felt that I'm missing a community and why do I feel only normal when I'm in rehab, and I felt that that wasn't a good feeling to have. And so having experienced that, I said, I don't want other people to experience this way that they are a circus when they're out in the community, and they only belong when they are in rehab. That's not a lifestyle. Right. So I didn't want them to feel that they are only \"normal\" air quotes when they're in rehab, or when they are in hospital, that they can participate in the community, just as they are with or without a prosthetic or being an amputee and I had a struggle to find that group, in Canada. I had searched and searched online and where I can turn to for support with other amputees if I had questions going through my journey, at the beginning of this, of course, I didn't know what to expect, right? I've never been an amputee before. And so I had a lot of questions. And we had this culture where a doctor is up higher on the totem pole, and patients are lower on the totem pole, where, should I be asking that question? Is that a stupid question? So where can I go for these resources. And I found a community, amazingly enough, in the United States, I flew to the United States to attend an amputee conference. And yes, there is a conference for amputees. And I enjoyed that feeling of community where we were in this one conference hotel. And we're all staying in the same hotel where everywhere you walk, every elevator you get on, there is an amputee, every bar you go to is there's an amputee sitting down who's willing to talk to you, without any hesitation at all, because it feels like family, even though you've never met them in your life. After the first Hi, my name is this, the conversation just kind of naturally happens and and I loved and enjoyed that feeling of I smile and a wave at someone and it's great. And so when I had come back from that and was inspired by that I said, that's what I was looking for, and if that's not happening or existing in my community, I'll create it. And that's how I started with the Amputee Coalition of Toronto. That started as let's just meet people in a social setting, because what I didn't want is the feeling of a basement where we get together, a church basement where we get together once a month, in a circle, expressing how we're feeling. I didn't want it to feel, as much as AA [alcoholics anonymous] is probably a really good group and they helped a lot of people. What I wanted was the social aspect of it. I wanted people to be out be seen and be comfortable being out and being seen. So my thought was, if we go out as a group, you forget that people are staying at one person or just staring at you. They're just staring at the whole group. And eventually they get tired, because those people are acting just as if they are a group of friends, having coffee, and chatting, and laughing. And that's what I want people to realize is that moving forward in your journey, is just adapting the things that you do every day, nothing stops you from doing what you want to do. So when I say limits are just in your mind, or people hear that expression limits are on your mind. It's true. Because if you realize, Hmm, I can do that, you will do it. And that's what I hope originally, that's what I hope the Amputee Coalition of Toronto will bring to people, is that: realizing the community exists, first of all, right, and by showing folks these things that we can do, you go back to whatever you're passionate about, and move on with your life, and live a better quality of life. It has also become so big now that we are also spreading awareness, to make sure sort of the same, you know, things that I'm advocating for is access to prosthetics, access to funding, because we don't get told those in hospitals or in our care, right, we do a lot of digging for ourselves. So if I can do or the Amputee Coalition of Toronto, can do half of that work for you where we say, Hey, you know what, you can access this funding for your sports, hey, you can access this funding for your prosthetics, there's this that you can do to, to get that kind of prosthesis. Because of everyone's collective experience, in going through what they've gone through, we can share that as a community and help each other out. And that's what the group is there for. Your life doesn't stop just because of an amputation. I look at it more as how do I move forward. And I think moving forward and growing from my circumstances, is always, has helped me cope with my amputation. You know, and if anyone is comfortable, fight along with me, fight along with us to fix the funding, and fix the access to equipment, and devices that allows us to live the best quality of our lives because a lot of times, it is the sole barrier that stops us from having a better quality of life and contributing to the community."}, {"speaker": "Jason Lo Hog Tian", "time": "42:24", "text": "We would like to take this time to give a massive thank you to all our guests, Aristotle Domingo, Dr. Amanda Mayo and Dr. Jan Andrysek, for their insight and expertise making this episode possible.

Yet, memory is not without its faults. In this episode of Raw Talk Podcast, we try to understand what memory is, the processes that affect the quality of our memories and the implications of faulty memory on the validity of eyewitness testimonies in the legal system. First we hear from Joey DeGrandis who shares his unique ability to recall specific details of autobiographical events. This rare memory phenomenon, known as Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM), provides an opportunity to investigate the brain systems underlying enhanced memory and conversely memory loss.  We then hear from Dr. Amy Finn, an assistant professor at the Department of  Psychology at the University of Toronto, and the principal investigator of the Learning and Neural Development Lab. Dr. Finn discusses memory formation and how the brain and cognitive development constrains and enables learning, using examples, such as the famous case of patient H.M. To better understand the 'faults in our memory', Dr. Daniel Schacter, a Harvard University Professor, discusses his work on how memory's malfunctions may be classified into seven fundamental transgressions or \"sins\" and describes the seven sins of memory errors. Finally, we hear from Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, who shares her experience on how memory may be manipulated and modified by messages, ideas, suggestions and other post-event information.  Dr. Loftus' memory research has had significant applications to the legal field, given its reliance on memory.

They call it like a 30-question test to sort of vet you to see if you have HSAM and it's just stuff like, you know what day of the week was Thanksgiving on in 1963. And they asked me like memory questions, and I passed the test. And I was diagnosed in August of 2011 when I went out there to visit Oregon, and his team.

And music is certainly one of those things. Actually you guys, I was just listening to an episode you guys did about new music therapy. Yeah. And that's, I was loving that because I was relating to it, agreeing with it a lot. And I think music is so powerful in that way. But for me when I hear certain songs, and I guess this is also true with certain memories, you know, sometimes it'll move me to tears.

But again, that might be the retrieval mechanisms at work moving faster and quicker than I can comprehend. I've sort of described it in the past, an example that's a bit obsolete, the DVD, I remember when we used to have to go to select the chapter of the DVD. You know, in a way, I think that's what my mind does, it sort of just sifts through the file like, oh, okay, August 2005, access. But it happens quicker and faster than I know. There are times, however, when I might have to think a little harder about a certain timeframe or a certain event, if maybe if I if it isn't as fresh in my mind. But again, I'm not exactly sure why I absorb it in such and such a way. All I know is that if I do remember it again, it happens pretty quickly."}, {"speaker": "Noor Al Kaabi", "time": "12:53", "text": "Next, we spoke to Dr. Amy Finn, an assistant professor at the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto, and the principal investigator of the Learning and Neural Development Lab.  What would you say is a good definition of memory?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Amy Finn", "time": "13:07", "text": "The ability to maintain some aspect of your previous experience. In the short term, we would talk about sort of actively holding that and something like working memory. But there's also long-term memory, the ability to maintain something that you've previously experienced more than just on the order of seconds."}, {"speaker": "Noor Al Kaabi", "time": "13:28", "text": "What's the definition of learning then? And, how does it differ from memory?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Amy Finn", "time": "13:33", "text": "Yeah, so a lot of times when we talk about memory, we are careful to disentangle different processes in memory.  A lot of times people use a really \u201cjargony\u201d term called encoding to refer to the experience that you have when you're experiencing the information that is to be later remembered. And we're really interested in lots of aspects of the encoding process. And then there's separately laying the memories down, if you will. There are a lot of questions about why do we lay down something that we experienced and not others. And that's like one part of memory that we talked about. And then there's also the memory retrieval aspect of memory when something happens, and you're storing it somewhere, your ability to actually go in and retrieve that and pull that out of your memory stores. And so, memory is useful for sort of characterizing both of those processes and trying to understand, okay, if you don't remember something, or even if you do remember something, what's the encoding process like that got you to sort of lay down the memory originally and then another reason why you might not remember something could have to do with difficulty in actually retrieving it. So, it could theoretically be there, but isn't necessarily retrieved. I use the term learning and memory interchangeably very often. Generally speaking, learning is more concerned with the encoding process. It usually conflates both encoding and retrieval. I also think when people use the term learning, there's more focus on trying to understand how behavior changes, at least from a psychological perspective. In real time, as you're being exposed incrementally to information, oftentimes, we use the term learning when we're talking about a behavioral change that happens, after you're sort of responding to the same stimulus over and over and over and over.  You can look at things like learning curves. Basically, if you see the same thing, or let's say you're learning something like categories, and you don't know you're actually watching behavior that's reflecting the learning process. It\u00b4s working overtime, so, you're like faster to respond to things that are similar because you've learned something about them."}, {"speaker": "Noor Al Kaabi", "time": "15:47", "text": "How did we learn about what parts of the brain are important from memory?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Amy Finn", "time": "15:50", "text": "In the 50s, or 60s, a rather famous patient H.M. underwent a surgery to cure his epilepsy. And that surgery involves bilaterally resecting his hippocampus and some surrounding tissue. Before they perform that operation on him it wasn't known what the consequences would be. Otherwise they would not have done this. The consequence was that he lost all abilities to lay down new memories. Well, he recently passed, but he was very studied at the MNI Institute in Montreal which is where a lot of this work took place. And Brenda Milner was the main scientist behind all of it. But it's how we learned the hippocampus is really crucial for laying down memory. H.M. couldn't lay down any new or what I want to call it long-term declarative memory, he retained all of the memories that he had prior to the surgery, he basically was off all memory development after that point. So, part of memory that's important. When we're remembering things that happened to us, our hippocampus becomes engaged again, various forms of memory distortion can happen again, we miss remember something you can actually fundamentally change the nature of the memory, the trace of the thing that actually originally happened to you. And I think those processes were different in H.M. because he didn't have a hippocampus. Initial theories about the neurobiology of memory has been very much influenced by him. I talked about the hippocampus, which I think is the brain part that people would be most excited about but there's others. The basal ganglia can be really important for this procedural form of memory. The cerebellum can also be really important for this form of procedural memory. Memories actually migrate to the parts of the brain that are important for that domain of expertise, the sensory cortices that are important for it. And so, cortex itself all across cortex is important for memory."}, {"speaker": "Noor Al Kaabi", "time": "17:46", "text": "Your research focuses heavily on brain development. Can you walk us through how memory is developed in children?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Amy Finn", "time": "17:52", "text": "Kids are uniquely good at being able to learn language, and they're uniquely good at learning various nonverbal,  synchronization activities that occur sometimes, or sometimes in music. And they have various other learning advantages. They often notice things that are task irrelevant, can reflect having been exposed to something when their attention is focused on something else in a way that adults don't. I guess, one way of calling that is that they're more distractible, and they have under-developed attention systems. But there's various benefits to that for memory. And so, I'm really interested in those things. And I've put forth a theoretical framework where I've suggested that having this more implicit procedural system in place earlier, with an associated longer development in the declarative systems all of the hippocampally mediated forms of learning produces qualitatively different learning outcomes and different learning strengths during childhood that allow us to do things like learn language, which some would argue one of our most uniquely human ability."}, {"speaker": "Zeynep Kahramanoglu", "time": "19:04", "text": "Shifting focus from kids to the other end of the spectrum. Dr. Daniel Schacter, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, where he leads the memory lab told us about how memory is affected in older adults and an age-related disease. "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Daniel Schacter", "time": "19:16", "text": "One of the most interesting things about memory is that it's not perfect. It's not like a computer, if it was, it might not be that interesting. Not only are memory lapses, important in everyday life, because they can frustrate us and cause problems. But they also provide insights into the way in which memory is built."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "19:40", "text": "Memories can fade in a healthy brain. But this also happens in disease as a key symptom, for example, in Alzheimer's. What is the difference in transience in health and in disease?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Daniel Schacter", "time": "19:54", "text": "Probably just that, you know, it's quicker and it's caused by pathology to the brain. So normal trends transience is not necessarily a pathological feature, we shouldn't think of them as flaws or defects in memory, but rather features of the system that have some benefits as well as cost. So, in the case of transients, we wouldn't want to hold on forever to every bit of information that we encounter, because a lot of it is useless. We don't want to have it cluttering up our minds and remaining very active and remaining very accessible. But that's a sharp contrast to let's say, an Alzheimer patient, where there's neuropathology, that creates a kind of devastating transience that prevents the person from functioning normally in everyday life. So, I think, at that level, you can make the case that some measure of forgetting of transience, has adaptive features and various researchers have argued for that. It is much harder to argue in the case of Alzheimer's, and in amnesic patient where the transience is so severe that the person cannot independently function and are not going to think of that as an adaptive feature of memory."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "21:15", "text": "And how does aging functionally affect memories is that similar to diseases that we were just mentioning?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Daniel Schacter", "time": "21:21", "text": "And some respects, but not nearly as severe. And there have been some studies that suggest that there is an acceleration of transients in some paradigms, some tasks with aging, but it's not to the point where it's going to impair a healthy older adult\u00b4s ability to function in the real world. It tends to be more of a loss of access to specific information over time, a lot of details. Older adults are pretty good at retaining the gist of information, the general features over time. That's true of everybody, we tend to lose more and more specific detail more quickly than just information. But I think it's particularly true of older adults that they're good at retaining the general idea over time and what gets hit there is more specific details that are harder to hold on to over time."}, {"speaker": "Noor Al Kaabi", "time": "22:16", "text": "Memory is inherently faulty. And we've all experienced it, whether it's blanking on a test, or forgetting the name of someone you just met. To better understand the faults in our memory. Dr. Schacter describes what he calls the \u201cseven sins of memory\u201d, a topic he's written extensively on. He begins with three sins related to omission errors."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Daniel Schacter", "time": "22:37", "text": "So, there were three that I called sins of omission, there are three different kinds of forgetting. The first I called transience, and this is something we're all familiar with it to some extent in everyday life that all other things being equal, memories tend to become harder to retrieve as time goes by. And there are various reasons for that. And that's probably the most common of the sins of omission. This was something that goes back all the way to the really the very beginnings of experimental psychology, when a German psychologist by the name of Hermann Ebbinghaus, published the first experimental study of memory. And he was the first to, to show a forgetting curve in memory. Using himself as his only subject, he was able to show something that's been replicated thousands of times since that there's a very particular shape of the forgetting curve. So that's what I would think of as the curve of transience. And so when we're trying to think about how memory develops over time, then we want to understand why is it that memories become more difficult to retrieve as time goes by. Is it just time, is it that there's more time for interfering information to get in the way, and that's probably the more likely explanation than just the passing of time. And, for example, in cases of amnesic patients, what you're seeing is almost like a hyper transience where they can take it, they can encode new information, but they just can't hold on to it for very long, it just fades away very quickly. So that would be like an exaggeration of transience in my terminology. Then this second of the of the forgetting related sins I call absent mindedness. This has the same result as transience, you forget something, but I think it has a very different underlying basis. So, this refers to kind of a breakdown at the interface of attention and memory, where we may be behaving on automatic, we put our teaser glasses down and we don't really encode that as an event in memory. It doesn't really ever get into memory in a way that we could retrieve it later. And because we're operating on automatic thinking about other things, we lose that information immediately or we don't really encode it. That's one way that absent mindedness can occur. Another way that absent mindedness can occur is on the retrieval side, where we may have fully encoded an event. And we want to carry out an action in the future related to that event. But one of the important things about memory, particularly when we're thinking about carrying out intended actions, is that we need to have a cue or a reminder present at the moment the action needs to be carried out. Lest we can forget almost anything. So when I wrote the original book on the seven sins of memory back in 2001, I gave the example of, of Yo Yo Ma, the famous cellist to get into a taxi cab one day, put his multimillion dollar cello in the trunk of the cab, took a cab ride downtown, thinking of other things, got out of the cab, paid the cab driver and walked away. And then suddenly, he remembered, hey, I'm here to play my cello, I don't have my cello. Eventually, they recovered it. So that's an example of where he perfectly in some sense perfectly well knew that the cello is in the trunk but at the moment, he needed to be reminded that it was there, he was thinking of other things and with absent mindedness this happened. Third one I call blocking. So that's where information has gotten into memory. It hasn't faded away over time, and you have a queue. At the moment, you're trying to pull out that information, but you just can't get to it. Information is inhibited in some way or inaccessible. Probably the most familiar example of this to most people would be the tip of the tongue phenomenon. You know, you know, something, you're given strong retrieval cues for it, you're trying your best, you're focusing, you're attending, you're doing all those things, but you just can't pull it up. But then at some later time, the information becomes available, showing that it was in my, you know, parlance, blocked. It didn't disappear, you just couldn't get at it at the time. And that's something that again, can affect people in everyday life. And it tends to be information that we haven't used recently or is less familiar to us that's prone to blocking. It's there, but the connections aren't so strong that we can retrieve everything we want at the moment. So, there are things you can do about blocking, even though once you've gotten into like a tip of the tongue state or a block state, for example, you show up at a party and there's someone whose face is familiar and you can't remember their name, by that time, it's going to be hard to overcome the retrieval blocking. But there are things you can do proactively. For example, if you know you're going to be in a situation where you're going to encounter some people who you know, you'd like to be able to remember their name, but you don't see them very often, it might be worth trying to, you know, review who's going to be there. And you can proactively prevent that kind of blocking. "}, {"speaker": "Noor Al Kaabi", "time": "28:11", "text": "The first three sins of memory are about omission: transience, absent mindedness and blocking. The others are about comission. And Dr. Schacter describes those."}, {"speaker": "Zeynep Kahramanoglu", "time": "28:20", "text": "The following guests talk about sexual assault, this content may be triggering for some individuals."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Daniel Schacter", "time": "28:27", "text": "The three sins of comission that relate to memory distortion, first one I call misattribution. So, this is one you recall some aspect of an event, but you confuse the source of that memory. Maybe you know, you think that a friend told you this interesting bit of information when you actually saw it on TV or vice versa. And we know that source of misattributions from lots of experiments are very common in many people. They're very important because once you forget the source of information but remember some aspect of an event that really occurred, you can become very convinced that this event actually occurred because you are remembering some aspect of it correctly. Probably one of the most dramatic cases of this has to do with a memory researcher by the name of Donald Thompson.  Actually, just a few years before he got his PhD with Endel Tulving at the University of Toronto, and went back to his native Australia, where he worked as a memory researcher and expert on memory and court cases. And you can imagine how shocked he was when he was accused of rape on the basis of the memory of a woman who had in fact been brutally raped, and had a detailed enough recollection of the rapist or what she thought was the rapist to actually result in Thompson being questioned by the police. But he couldn't have committed this rape because at the moment that it occurred, he was on live television giving an interview about, of all things, memory and memory distortion. And that proved to be the reason that he got involved, that this woman was watching the television, watching this very television show seeing Thompson at the moment an intruder broke in and in the stress of this event, confused the face of Thompson with the rapist. So fortunately, he had an airtight alibi. But that's an extreme case and unusual case. But there are lots of other things similar to that in legal settings where someone is absolutely convinced that they're remembering an event correctly. And they are remembering some aspect of it that really happened. But they're wrong. So, and one of the things we've been very interested in my lab is the question of with these kind of misattributed memories, if you look at what's going on in the brain, can you tell the difference between an accurate memory that you're making the correct attribution about and a false memory, where you remember something incorrectly and engage in this kind of misattribution process? And we and others have found that although there's a lot of overlap in brain activity for these kinds of true and false memories, there are some differences. And that's important, because, you know, really interesting question about misattribution, because it turns up a lot in court cases is, you know, can you use functional MRI, brain scanning evidence in the courtroom? We don't think that the field is quite gotten to the point where you can do that, because the question you're trying to answer there is for one person, and one event, can you say whether this event came from an actual experience, or is some kind of misattribution along the lines, we've talked about occurring. Most of the laboratory research that's been done over the past 2025 years using neuro imaging that shown for example, sensory reactivation effects, typically uses averages across lots of subjects, averages across a lot of items presented in a list and you get an average for true and false memories, that's different. But that's not the same thing as one person, one event. There have been a few attempts along those lines, but I don't think we have anything convincing enough yet that would, you know, allow us to, to use that technology with confidence in a courtroom. We've also got suggestibility, which is closely related to misattribution. Except that now we're talking about situations where some kind of misinformation is actively presented to people. Usually it's misleading information presented either after an event has occurred, that retroactively finds its way into the original event. So, this is some of the classic work from the 1970s from Elizabeth Loftus, on what's known as post event misinformation. And other more recent developments also dating initially to some of Loftus\u00b4 work and then many other researchers have shown that it's possible to implant memories of entire events that have never occurred through suggestion."}, {"speaker": "Zeynep Kahramanoglu", "time": "33:29", "text": "We'll actually be speaking with Dr. Elizabeth Loftus about her work a little later on in the episode. For now, Dr. Schacter continues with the seven sins of memory."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Daniel Schacter", "time": "33:39", "text": "The third one I call bias, retrospective bias, which can take various forms. And this is when our current knowledge, beliefs and feelings can skew our memories of the past and in a variety of ways. Probably the most common is what people call consistency bias, where you kind of revise your past beliefs and knowledge to bring them into line with your current knowledge and beliefs, and there's a lot of evidence on this point that people do this quite a bit. There's also something that I've called change bias, where there are certain circumstances where you can rewrite memory to exaggerate how much you've changed as a function of an experience. So, it's been shown that, you know, certain people when they get into self help programs will exaggerate the amount of change some of their initial ratings have experienced by, you know, retro actively changing them to make it seem like they've really changed or benefited more - kind of a motivational thing. There are stereotypical biases, which are biases that there's been a lot of focus on recently with work on implicit bias, how we can be biased by our past experience with stereotypes to have certain expectations of how people will behave. So, bias takes various forms and I think it's pretty subtle, but we don't really have a good understanding of the brain basis of a lot of these biases. And, you know, there's been a lot of discussion and work on implicit bias training where you're trying to train away some of the biases, the destructive biases, potentially destructive biases that people carry with them. Are there ways of eradicating those biases? The evidence there is pretty mixed. There was this vast study published a few years back, where a bunch of psychologists tried out a whole variety of different implicit bias training procedures, and only a very small percentage of them worked. And then the ones that worked, a follow-up study showed only work for a short period of time, and they kind of dissipated over time. So, they're well intentioned. They're important, but it's unclear yet based on very strict research evidence how effective, particularly over the long term, implicit bias training is, but it's a very important area."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "36:07", "text": "Absolutely. And that brings us to the last sin of memory, which is..."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Daniel Schacter", "time": "36:13", "text": "...persistence, I call it persistence. And this refers to when memory is present, but unwanted. So, we've all had the experience of like an unpleasant experience that keeps us up at night. And, in extreme forms may take the form of post traumatic stress disorder. And this can be a very disabling kind of memory sin, when it gets to the point, for example of being linked up with PTSD can definitely have a very impairing effect on psychological function. And there, we have learned a lot about the underlying brain basis of persistence effects in memory. Not surprisingly, because persistence happens for emotionally arousing and unpleasant experiences. It tends to be associated with brain regions linked with emotion. The one that psychologists and neuroscientists have studied the most is the amygdala, an almond shaped structure in the brain that is very much involved in our emotional memories. And it's been shown over and over again, that amygdala activation is associated with emotional memory, and sometimes with these persisting memories that can be disabling. And one of the things that neuroscientists have studied a lot over the past two decades, that's a really interesting feature of memory in general, is known as reconsolidation. And this refers to the idea that it's been long been accepted that it takes some time initially, some neural chemical processes, for us to consolidate a memory. But what's been shown initially in animal studies back in the 1970s, that were sort of forgotten about and then revived in an important paper from Karim Nader and Joe Le Doux in 2000 is that when you retrieve a memory, that puts it back into kind of a, what is referred to as an unstable or label state, where it has to be consolidated all over again. And if you interfere with that reconsolidation, you can knock out that memory. It's kind of counterintuitive that when you retrieve a memory, it has to be consolidated over again. And so, this is something now that has been looked at in studies of persistence; can you use reconsolidation? So, you can get people to bring up a troublesome experience inject someone with a protein synthesis inhibitor, a drug known as propranolol, a beta blocker that also interferes with protein synthesis. If you do those things together, reactivate a memory and give them a propranolol can that result in sort of taking some of the sting out of the memory so it's not so emotionally troublesome and persistence is reduced, and again, there's mixed evidence on this point, but there's at least some evidence suggesting that this may be a promising approach. But it's not really settled yet. In the literature, more extensive double-blind studies need to be done.

We spoke to Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, who is a distinguished professor at the University of California Irvine, a cognitive psychologist and an expert on human memory.

Or it can involve remembering an entire event that never happened to you but might have happened to somebody else. This is what I study, the malleability of memory. And so, in my experiments, we will expose people to some event. And then, after the event is completely over, we'll let them be exposed to some new details, maybe misinformation or disinformation about the event. And we look and see the extent to which they will adopt this misinformation included in their own memory, and it causes some kind of a change in memory. And this is something that I think goes on out there in the world, when people talk to other people about their experiences or when they are exposed to misleading information of some sort. All of these can provide this kind of opportunity for a distortion or contamination of memory. "}, {"speaker": "Noor Al Kaabi", "time": "41:11", "text": "False memories have implications in the courtrooms where people are being convicted for crimes. Eyewitness testimonies are often written from people's memories, but how reliable are they? "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Elizabeth Loftus", "time": "41:22", "text": "People have errors in their memory, probably all the time. But most of the time, it doesn't. It doesn't matter very much. I mean, so it doesn't matter if, if I tell you that last night, you know, I had a hamburger instead of chicken. You don't know there's something wrong with that story. I don't get caught in my mistake. But when it comes to legal cases where somebody liberty is at stake, and it really matters, who is the person? What did the person look like who committed the crime? And where you are potentially identifying an innocent person and implicating someone who's innocent and punishing that person and taking away their liberty. Then false memories, memory distortion matters very, very much, because we know that faulty memory is one of the major causes of innocent people being convicted of things they didn't do. So, one example might be, let's say, the victim and the perpetrator spent a fair amount of time together, maybe like they were together for a half hour. And then the perpetrator decides to rob the victim. And the perpetrator rubs the victim. And the very next day, the victim goes into a pizza parlor, and there's the perpetrator sitting there eating pizza, and the victim then calls up the police and says the person who robbed me yesterday is here. If it's a long exposure, not a lot of stress during most of the exposure. A fairly short retention interval, it's only a day later. There is no questionable police procedure and the identification because it was the pizza parlor identification. Maybe it's a same race identification, not across race problem. And so there may just not be very much problematic with that situation. It doesn't mean it's 100% accurate. But usually, it's more helpful. If a lawyer is going to ask a memory expert to come in and talk that there'll be a number of problematic factors that that expert can point to. In a typical eyewitness case, the expert might review all the police reports and preliminary hearing testimony statements a witness made and might be looking to see are there factors that are known from the psychological literature to produce difficulties for memory that the expert sees are present in this case. So, is it a cross racial identification, where as a member of one race is trying to identify a stranger of a different race, people make more mistakes. Is it a situation where there's a long passage of time and a lot of exposure, say to media or other suggestive insinuations that this particular person committed the crime? What kind of police procedure was used to elicit the identification? Was it fair? Was it a double-blind procedure where the person conducting the test did not know who the suspect was? That's the better procedure. So, these are just examples of things that an expert can look for.

And I think for, this is another way I've sort of described it, which might sort of make sense, especially, you know, to listeners, if anybody's a visual person like me, I sort of feel as if I am like almost a puppet to the timeline, like I can pull on a little string and I\u00b4ve pulled on a string and I've accessed a date or a memory, right, I'm anchored in that sense to my story to my timeline. And that is a wonderful thing that I love. And I cherish and I wouldn't trade, but that also sort of makes it so that I'm thinking about this time, or this place or this memory in the context of where I was at that time in my life, right? So for a 13 year old, let's say right, there's a lot of funny, awkward memories I have, but it's like 13 sucked, you know, 13 sucks. I don't care if you're popular, that's a fun spoiler I learned later in life, right, even for the popular people it sucked, right. And I was not popular. So it's like, I don't know if other people, because I certainly know that as a human being right, I feel like as a baseline, we all have memories that are tough for us or that are happy, right? We tend to remember emotionally charged things. But maybe for me, the only difference is that I remember it a little more readily a little more in a more accessible way. And it's just the fact that I can, when I'm thinking of it, it's like, if I'm not careful, I go into like a rabbit hole of like, this is the context of my time. And I was an awkward teen and it was so uncomfortable, then, you know, and certainly just perhaps maturing. I don't know growing up for me, you know, like maybe over time, I feel like that has lessened the emotional sort of impact has kind of lessened just because, you know. Not only do I have more things to worry about in the present and I\u00b4m so grateful that, knock on wood, that I had a pretty happy life, all things considered.You know, I don't tend to like let myself get lost too much. So, it's right to go back. I've heard it also described as in science, it's, I think the recovery window of time when something happens whether it's traumatic or you know, just something that's emotional to you that's you know, perhaps bad, right and there's a recovery window of time when you find the process and sort of move on from. That I think people with HSAM perhaps have a slightly longer recovery window or wider just because again, it's the memory is a little more active and palpable if that makes sense. I should you know, thank my lucky stars if you will, that I've had a generally happy life. I mean, I've suffered and had sad stories just like anybody, but you know, for me what I, a lot of times those memories come back and it's almost just like the loss of innocence or youth or childhood right. So, it is not even a sad thing. It's just like, oh, what this music reminds me of.

And is it accurate to say that we are in a way building memories, every time that we recall them?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Daniel Schacter", "time": "52:58", "text": "Yeah, I think that is accurate that to some extent, depending on exactly how we retrieve, where we retrieve, circumstances in which retrieve. That retrieving memories, and my lab has been very active in showing this in behavioral studies in fMRI, retrieving memories can change that it can strengthen them, but it can also distort them under certain circumstances. And yes, and that all fits with the view that memory is a strongly construct of phenomenon. It's not simply an archive or reproduction of the past. And really, the origins of that view go back a long way. In psychology, most people would attribute at the initial articulation of that idea to the Great British psychologist Sir Frederick Bartlett. And I think what we've been able to do over the last 20 or 30 years is really link some of those constructive processes that Bartlett initially talked about, more closely to the brain, and to see, you know, in action, how we construct memories. And I think, you know, the whole seven sins framework is really an articulation of a constructive memory point of view, particularly the three distortion related sins are what really bring out I think, the constructive nature of memory. But again, going back to our earlier discussion, this is not the reflection of a sub optimal or flawed or a pathological system. There are benefits to a constructed memory system. So for example, what Bartlett initially talked about and what others a lot of others have talked about, is that because we're pretty good about retaining the gist of information, we sometimes lose the particulars that is a recipe for misattribution and memory distortion, but that's a good thing in other ways because we want to hold on to the important things, as I talked a little bit earlier. And if when we hold on to the gist, but we don't retain the specifics, then we're set up for certain kinds of memory distortion. Now, another perspective that is something that's come out of the work of my lab, and others, again during the past really 1520 years, that fits with this constructed view is the idea that the main function of memory may not be, as we've always thought to allow us just to reminisce about the past, and go back and travel in time into the past, but also to use our past experiences to project into the future, to think about the future to imagine what's going to happen. And so, we've been working with an idea that we have called the constructive, episodic simulation hypothesis for a little over a decade now. And this is the idea that memory, particularly our episodic memory, or memory for everyday personal experiences, is important not only for remembering the past, but also for using that information in a way that's useful to us to imagine into the future. And some of the origins of this work, go back to actually an observation that Endel Tulving made regarding an amnesic patient that her and I were testing one day in Toronto in the early 1980s. Very severely amnesic patient, known it the literature as patient KC, who was a result of a head injury that damaged his hippocampus, medial temporal lobe, parts of his frontal lobe parts of his parietal lobe, had no capacity to remember any specific past episode. And Tulving asked them a simple question, \u201cwhat do you think you're going to do tomorrow?\u201d And you might think that he would have no problem with that. Although we know he had a terrible problem answering, \u201cWhat did you do yesterday?\u201d Well, what was really striking at the time, is that the patient really couldn't conjure up any particular image or scene or event that might happen to him tomorrow. He drew the same kind of blank that he did, when you ask him what happened to you yesterday, eventually, he would say something like I, you know, maybe I'd have breakfast, and I would have lunch. And that was a very striking, singular early observation. And then we followed up many years later, in my lab in 2007, and some others at the same time, by doing functional neuroimaging studies showing that many of the same brain regions come online when you remember the past and you imagine the future. Our episodic memories are built to be very flexible, and to allow us to recombine bits and pieces of our past experience, so that we can run simulations of novel upcoming events, things that haven't happened before. Because after all, the future is rarely an identical replay of the past. So, we want to be able to prepare for novel situations, we think we can do that, with a flexible memory system that allows us to recombine bits and pieces of past experience but that can also result in memory errors, and really speaks to the heart of constructive memory. And indeed, in some recent work from my lab, we've been able to show that these flexible recombination processes that we think are so important for imagining the future and engaging in a variety of other cognitive functions can indeed sometimes lead us to memory misattributions of the kind that we were talking about earlier. So, when I think of constructive memory, I think of it as something that has cost, but also has potential benefits in supporting our ability to imagine the future and various other kinds of important cognitive functions."}, {"speaker": "Zeynep Kahramanoglu", "time": "58:41", "text": "As you go on with your day, think about how you may be using your memory to construct your future, and perhaps think about what your imagined future would look like.

In this episode, the hosts from the series came together (distanced and wearing masks, of course) to discuss what we learned from the series, key themes that emerged, and our personal reflections on living through the pandemic. We review the current state of testing in Canada, discuss the social determinants of COVID-19 risk and the importance of gathering race-based data, and reflect on the lessons we can learn going forward.

So the last six months have been a bit surreal as the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic. And we just wanted to say, we hope that you're all doing well. Stay safe and take time for yourself. Like many of you, we've been trying to keep up with the rapid pace of COVID-19 discovery and the evolving public health situation since March. And, as we adapt to the new normal, it's clear that the current pandemic has far-reaching effects on health, research, society, and even our planet. So over eight weeks this summer, we hosted COVID decoded, a series of live stream discussions all about COVID-19. We spoke with neurologists and epidemiologists, experts in public health, mental health, climate change and health equity, scientists at the forefront of developing COVID-19 tests and leaders of the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force. We learned so much from this series and wanted to kick off our new season by bringing you the highlights of the discussions and our reflections and lessons learned. Before we begin, we wish to acknowledge the slant on which the University of Toronto and our podcasts operates. For thousands of years, it has been the traditional Land of the Huron Wendat, the Seneca and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island, and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land. Today's episode will feature all of the COVID decoded hosts, the reflections on the series and highlights from the livestream discussions. My name is Kat, and I will be your host of hosts. Now, one last thing before we jump into today's discussion. To celebrate almost half a decade of Raw Talk, we are hosting a 'Friendraiser' and need your help to spread the word.

Now we'll be pulling some clips from our live stream audio, but if you'd like to hear the full discussion, all of the links are available in our show notes. So I guess a good place to start is way back in March when everything first went into lockdown. We had been hearing about this novel coronavirus for weeks at that point. But, it felt like everything just happened very suddenly. One day we were going into the lab and then the next everyone was being told to stay home, businesses were closing down, hospitals were preparing for this huge wave of cases. Do you remember how you were all feeling around the start of the pandemic? Nathan, let's start with you."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "3:08", "text": "Sure. Uh, I know you mentioned March but I'm going to actually scroll back a bit to late December early January. I was on Raw Talk Podcast, and we were doing the uh, prep for the episode on pandemics. So you know this was this had come up, right in January, we had been talking to a whole bunch of public health experts, and then towards the end of January, we couldn't even find public health experts to talk to, because it was just so difficult to find someone who could talk on, about this new COVID-19, at the time we didn't even know it was called COVID-19. We called it the novel Coronavirus. So, come around March, how did I feel about this pandemic? You know, I haven't heard my discussion, having seen the lockdown in Wuhan and you know, chatting with the people on pandemics on the pandemics episode, I was kind of seeing this as like, well about time, you know, this, this was gonna happen. I will say that like I was more concerned about not myself personally, because I'd been kind of like keeping track of this from the pandemics episode, but rather actually I was more concerned about people around me."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "4:08", "text": "And Grace, what about you?"}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "4:09", "text": "I think in general, we were all feeling a lot of uncertainty. And uh, just generally like worry about the situation because we were being, kind of kicked out of our labs, and some of us are unable to do our research. Some of us at least were having our research disrupted in terms of, kind of our everyday that we were used to."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "4:27", "text": "Yeah, that's a really excellent point. Since most of us on the team are graduate students, the pandemic has also had an impact on our research. And in our final stream with Dr. David Naylor, who's the co chair of Canada's COVID-19 Immunity Task Force, he made a really excellent point about the impact of the pandemic on research trainees and young investigators specifically."}, {"speaker": "Dr. David Naylor", "time": "4:49", "text": "The biggest worry is, to me not so much collaboration, but, you know, we put a whole bunch of young people on ice because we've suspended some of our usual activities, labs were closed for a long time, young investigators who weren't in this field would be struggling to make their way. Some o-, some senior investigators, younger investigators pivoted and capitalized on COVID funding. But the response capacity we have in science in Canada was built over decades. And we can't have this event. And, you know, being a situation where we don't continue building that capacity across the board. And to me that, you know, one of the big lessons of this terrible epidemic is Canada needs strong science capacity, it has to build the next generation, it has to sustain the current generation of scientists that can't be focused only narrowly, some of the people are doing the best work pivoted from other areas. So that to me is is the bigger long term concern, collaboration right now is brilliant. But let's make sure we build capacity at home to continue to do our fair share in the years ahead."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "5:55", "text": "So was your research impacted by the pandemic? And how are you coping with that? Yagnesh, maybe you can start us off."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "6:02", "text": "Sure. So I work in a wet lab in uh, I work with cells, so I have to go in on weekends, on random times to go and replenish the media, which means to feed the cells basically. So, what I ended up having to do, since we had locked down for three months was I just had to freeze them all. So uh, you freeze them all at minus 80. And they, you can re-thaw them, but this is not a very efficient process. You lose a lot of cells, and I was working on making a specialized gene engineered cell line. And right after I had isolated it, I had to put it on ice, pretty much. So, my project was in ice for three months, and I think I was coping with it, okay, like my PI is very uh, nice and supportive. So I didn't have that pressure. But outside of that, it is quite jarring to be honest. Like, I can't work on my, something that I've dedicated so much time to. And that's affecting, like how fast I can graduate. So let's, I'd say I'm doing okay, overall, but could be better."}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "7:10", "text": "You know, I actually was kind of fortunate in that um, you know, my research to get put on hold and in, in a way. But, I was actually able to do a little bit of research on COVID, um, because my lab does mathematical modeling research. So I was looking into the serial interval of COVID and the generation time, which is basically the, the average amount of time between subsequent infections. And so I was able to kind of feel like I was contributing to the solution, in a way working on some of that stuff. But, on the other hand, we had a lot of conversations with our lab, as we were pivoting towards COVID research a little bit, you know, how much can we really put on hold all those other commitments that we made to, to other grants and, and community members that we were working with for that previous research and um, making sure that we really weighed the pros and cons of, you know, how we're spending our time."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "7:57", "text": "Sounds like everyone's had to go through a lot of changes and adjustments, whether it's putting your research on hold, or, you know, kind of pivoting, what you're studying. And I know, as a podcast, one of the biggest changes that we had to make was our annual live event. So we were in the midst of planning, you know, a 200-person live podcasting event on climate change and health around the time that the pandemic was declared. So obviously, we had to make some changes. And after much discussion, we landed on the topic and format of what is now the COVID Decoded series. And honestly, I think when we decided to do livestream discussions with experts on the subject of COVID-19, I don't think any of us really understood what we were getting into. And as a podcast, we're definitely very used to relying on our editors to make us all sound good. But with a live stream that really wasn't an option. So in terms of hosting, what were some of the biggest challenges with moving to the livestream format. And Eryn, as one of the co-organizers of this event, maybe you can tell us a little bit about that."}, {"speaker": "Eryn Tong", "time": "8:57", "text": "You know, as a host, I think a lot of us had plenty of experience being a host on a regular season. But again, I think like Kat mentioned, we always have the safety blanket of our audio engineers to, you know, cut out inconcise language to cut out filler words and we really didn't have that option. And I think that also added a bit of anxiety to hosting the livestream, because we don't have that safety blanket and also that it's going to be recorded permanently on YouTube, which was an added layer of anxiety. And then in terms of the actual day of, I think learning how to juggle everything while live was a big adjustment. Learning how to handle all the logistical challenges offline with the team, while still being engaged in the discussion with the guests, was definitely something that I learned to do."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "9:45", "text": "Yagnesh, you were our first livestream host. Any comments on that experience?"}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "9:49", "text": "I really enjoyed it. But before then, uh we had like two weeks I know, me and you were sitting in that small room along with uh, Alex trying to figure out like every little detail, try to put up the our poster up behind to make it look like a new show. Yeah, it was, it was kind of fun and uh, very nerve-racking at that point. So yeah, once I got started and got over the jitters, it was just like a normal podcast interview."}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "10:16", "text": "Yeah, it was all, it was all very stressful, but at the end of the day, I think people understand these days that technology, you're limited by it. But on the other hand, we appreciate the fact that we can even have these kind of opportunities because of technology in the first place. So-"}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "10:32", "text": "Also a shout out to, especially on the technical side of things, Alex, but also Richie and Nathan and other members of our team who, every day that we were recording, as well as a lot of time on top of that, were kind of in our like makeshift studio, troubleshooting, making sure everything went smoothly, all the different components that were involved in making the livestream, still kind of professional and look as good as it did."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "10:56", "text": "Yeah, thanks for that Grace, definitely could not have done it without our team. And, you know, despite all of those difficulties, I think that our team really came through and put together a great series of discussions. I definitely learned a lot from each livestream and it really helped me wrap my mind around the research on COVID and the wider impact of the pandemic. Actually, our very first stream with Dr. Karen Mossman, virologist and vice president of research at McMaster University was super informative in terms of understanding what the SARS-coV-2 virus was, and how it was different from the original SARS virus back in 2003."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Karen Mossman", "time": "11:28", "text": "The two viruses are I think, at the protein level about 95% similar. So we're not surprised that SARS-2 uses the same receptors as the original SARS, but that it can't be as simple as that because, you know, the the symptoms and the ability to transmit are very different. You know, the original SARS was more of a lower respiratory tract infection, not an upper, the original SARS didn't transmit as efficiently. But it did have a higher mortality rate. Whereas when you have predominantly an upper and nasal sort of infection, that's partially what really lends itself to that transmission. Because any cough, any sneeze, runny nose, um, saliva, I mean it when you have a really upper respiratory tract and nasal type of infection, transmission is much more robust than if it's a really deep lower respiratory tract infections. And another subtle difference with this virus is and again, it could be due to those, you know, its 5% changes, but 5% is still you know, quite a bit at the protein level, you know, the ability to have the infections that are the asymptomatic infections. There were very few asymptomatic infections that we understood with the original SARS, if you really develop that lower respiratory tract infection, you know, and almost everyone that has symptoms was positive. You know, now we know there's a lot of asymptomatic carriers, and that enabled spread. And I think that's really why, you know, we're seeing we're seeing such robust spread. If you don't know you have it, it's hard, it's easier to quarantine and to protect yourself, if you know you're infected. If you don't know you're infected, it's so much easier to spread the virus."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "13:24", "text": "So Yagnesh, you hosted the conversation with Dr. Mossman. Can you tell us more about what you learned about asymptomatic transmission."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "13:31", "text": "So with the lower respiratory versus upper respiratory, I think that's a good point that she brought up because in one of the first large seroprevalence studies that came out of Spain, in early July, I'd say the majority of the Spanish population was tested as seronegative, the SARS-CoV-2 infections and even in hotspot areas, the infection rates aren't very high. And most PCR confirmed cases actually do have detectable antibodies. But a substantial portion of the people that did show symptoms, did not have PCR tests, and at least a third of the infections that were determined through serology were asymptomatic, which is huge. 33% of the population that had it didn't show any symptoms. And as Dr. Mossman mentioned, it's huge in how this virus transmits. So I think that's a very good point."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "14:27", "text": "Speaking of testing, our sixth episode was focused on COVID-19 testing, and in particular, our guests Dr. Adeli, head of clinical biochemistry at SickKids, and Mary Kathryn Bohn, one of his graduate students, clarified the difference between the two types of tests that can be done. First, there are viral PCR tests, which assess whether you have an active infection. And then there's also antibody testing, which can detect the presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2."}, {"speaker": "Mary Kathryn Bohn", "time": "14:54", "text": "So I think the most commonly used test right now, is of course the PCR test, the molecular test for the viral RNA to detect current infection. So that would be for example, if someone was presenting with some clinical symptoms that were similar to COVID, and presented to an emergency department or a hospital, they could get tested in order to see if they were actively infected. On the other hand, you could also use this for screening. So for individuals who are about to have surgery, or about to enter perhaps a long-term care facility, you can determine if there is an active infection there."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "15:26", "text": "So the test that Mary Kathryn is referring to in this clip is the one that's done using the nasopharyngeal swab. Just out of curiosity, has anyone here gotten tested?"}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "15:35", "text": "I haven't actually gotten tested. But everyone I talked to who has says, it's really uncomfortable, but it doesn't hurt."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "15:40", "text": "Okay, I'm gonna have to beg to differ. So I had the misfortune of having to go and visit an ER about two weeks ago. And in visiting an ER, they make everybody get a COVID test. And uh, painful is one word, I would maybe use to describe it? It's, it felt like somebody was taking a pick into my brain. Um, which was not nice. I mean, like, I, if frankly, like, if I wanted to get tested, like I would get tested again. But like, I would rather just not get infected in the first place. Because it was not a pleasant experience."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "16:12", "text": "The closest analogy I'd say is like someone trying to pull your brain out through your nose. It's not fun, but..."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "16:18", "text": "And that's not painful?"}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "16:19", "text": "Actually not painful. Like it was just uncomfortable. You know, like someone doing it with surgical precision,"}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "16:25", "text": "Okay, but like, there are parts of my head and face that I did not know existed, until I got my COVID test."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "16:32", "text": "Good to know. So if any of you who haven't gotten the test, there you have it. So the second type of test that we discussed was the antibody test, which is not being done widely yet. But I'll let Mary Kathryn explain."}, {"speaker": "Mary Kathryn Bohn", "time": "16:46", "text": "The tests that are currently available at Health Canada, they're not testing for whether these antibodies can be used to combat the virus, just that you have them. If you're antibody positive, that doesn't necessarily mean that your um, viral tests may be negative. So you can be positive for both tests and therefore, if you detect antibodies, it doesn't necessarily mean that you're totally past the infection. They tell you nothing about the immunity status. So that would require more specialized tests, which what we would call a neutralization assay, and those tests aren't really broadly available right now. So just because you have or let's say you test positive for these antibodies doesn't mean that you are immune to prior or previous infection."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "17:25", "text": "So there's a lot we still don't know about antibody testing and immunity for the COVID-19 virus. But Mary Kathryn made it clear that continuing testing should be a key part of our public health strategy moving forward."}, {"speaker": "Mary Kathryn Bohn", "time": "17:36", "text": "I think the consensus among laboratory professionals has been test, test, test. Test as much as possible, especially for molecular testing, not only in people who present with symptoms, but also as we alluded to earlier, for screening purposes, when you know, someone may be undergoing surgery where there's a risk of aerosolization or if they're going in to an area with more at-risk populations. So I think the availability of testing and particularly molecular testing has been really key in guiding public health decisions in terms of exposure, um, in many different populations. I think antibody testing hasn't yet got there in terms of its use in public health, but I think in the next few months, we'll definitely see these serological assays playing a much greater role."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "18:22", "text": "A current key role of antibody tests has been in the large scale seroprevalence studies that are led by Canada's COVID-19 Immunity Task Force co-chaired by Dr. David Naylor. Dr. Naylor was a guest in our last episode focused on immunity and Canada. Grace, as the host of this livestream, did anything stand out to you about the results of these studies?"}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "18:41", "text": "In our discussion, Dr. Naylor shared findings that over 20,000 Canadians have been tested so far, using sources like Canadian Blood Services, and H\u00e9ma-Quebec, and that the general prevalence in the population seems to be around 1%. So this is about three times higher than the rates we're currently finding using tests for active infections. And for context, in the study that Yagnesh mentioned earlier, the prevalence in Spain has been found to be around 5%. So this low prevalence really highlights the high susceptibility to the virus that Canadians still have, and the need for continued precautions to prevent outbreaks."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "19:12", "text": "The same things have also been seen in pets. So there was a study of about 700 Italian pets. And they found that about 3 to 4% of the pets actually had antibodies to the COVID virus so it mirrors very similarly to humans. What's not known though, currently is whether they can infect humans again."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "19:35", "text": "It sounds like research on the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the development of these tests has been moving quite rapidly. And it's been cool to see how quickly scientists can pivot from their typical research to study the new coronavirus, and to establish collaborations globally to do that. But we've seen this type of enthusiastic response to pandemics and epidemics before. In our final livestream with Dr. David Naylor, he called for continued investment in immunology research and public health."}, {"speaker": "Dr. David Naylor", "time": "20:00", "text": "We need to invest in virology, we need to keep investing in immunology, we need to keep the science substrate going. And I do worry that we, we get focused on virology after every fresh outbreak or epidemic of any proportion, just as we get focused on public health for a year or two. And then this kind of thinking goes into advance, there will be more zoonoses, there will be more outbreaks. They may come faster with global warming and the crowding of the planet. And I think we need to be on alert for more of the same and the years ahead, and that's simply an imperative in terms of the science and the public health investments need to be made in the future."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "20:41", "text": "Dr. David Naylor has been a huge advocate for science research and funding in Canada. You can hear more about that and from him on Episode 65: Investing in Knowledge, the Life Cycle of Research, as well as Episode 66: Investing in Tomorrow, Why are you Voting Science."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "20:55", "text": "And this idea of continued investment and planning, essential in our ability to respond to future waves of COVID-19, or other future pandemics, was echoed by Dr. Vivek Goel, member of the Governing Council for CanCOVID, the National Research platform for COVID-19 research, in our fourth installment of the COVID Decoded series."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Vivek Goel", "time": "21:13", "text": "So first of all, I think we need to be honest with the population about the vaccine. And I agree with you, it's one to two years, uh not operation warp speed, and not by December like Donald Trump is promising. Um, and then we as he also said, we have to be honest that it will take several more years to roll out a global campaign, because it's not just a you know, we will have to prioritize in Canada, but we'll have to prioritize around the world. And you know, we're going to be looking at getting at least 5 billion doses to people around the world to get to levels of herd immunity. We also don't know if the vaccine will need to, we'll have to do it annually, like flu or so on. So I think we have to be honest with people about how long it's going to take, and what that's going to look like. And I think we also have to be ready for a Fall wave and for continued sporadic outbreaks. We can't just keep saying, we're gonna have to go back into another lockdown. If we can't manage it, we have to be ready. And we know a lot more than we did back in March. We know about which kinds of communities the outbreaks were in, which kinds of work settings, let's make sure that they're prepared, so we don't have outbreaks in meatpacking plants, and long term care facilities, um, homeless shelters, agriculture workers. Like we know the settings in which we've had the outbreaks and so we should really be focusing on those. We know the people that are most likely to get hospitalized and die. And so we need to make sure we have the supports for those. But we also know that there's a lot of people who are much lower risk."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "22:51", "text": "So what do you all think about the idea of preparing for a pandemic? Nathan, let's start with you."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "22:57", "text": "You know, after especially 2003, the IHR 2005, those are the International Health Regulations, they were created in the aftermath of the 2003 SARS pandemic. And then since then, we also have at least in Ontario Public Health, Ontario Toronto Public Health, all these coordinating public health agencies that were also created as an aftermath of the IHR. And so I think we can prepare for a pandemic. I think it's difficult, though, to prepare for the most severe event possible. Like this is a, an example of a situation or a tail risk that is very, very, very large and long, and difficult to deal with and hard to quantify. And so you know, we ca- I think we can prepare for pandemics to an extent. We can prepare for them by like, doing what the IHR prescribe, monitoring your populations for, you know, abnormal symptoms and the spread of contagious infections. But it could be harder, I guess, to prepare for the most severe outcome, when, you know, it just never happens."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "24:01", "text": "I think where you're kind of getting at too is there's kind of like a cost-benefit analysis there too. Of course, it's really incredibly important to prepare for pandemics but like, how many resources we put into that and how extensive that preparation is, would obviously be an upfront cost. And kind of finding the balance there with like how much it would benefit us when we do actually have a pandemic."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "24:22", "text": "I will say in contrast to what Nathan said and a little bit to what you said, as well Grace, that we've known about coronaviruses and bats since the first outbreak. So while things have been moving, and it's hard to take like a holistic approach to a, like once-in-a-century event like uh, how this pandemic has been spreading, I will say, we do need to continue support for basic research into these topics, so we can be better prepared at just the basic general knowledge level of uh, in some of these cases, so I think we could definitely do a lot better as well."}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "25:05", "text": "Yeah, just want to echo those points both, actually, because I do think the public health response has been pretty successful, like we've known what to do. And then it's just a matter of implementation and one hand, but then I think one of the things we hadn't really considered is, what are the downstream implications of those kind of more hardline measures and, and the you know, public health kind of had an idea of what needs to get done, but you know, the economic suffering and what that means for people in their day-to-day lives on a, on a really long timescale, like we're looking at right now, I don't know if those kind of conversations had been happening in those spheres."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "25:38", "text": "I think you can definitely learn things from the first wave, as we've heard and plan for it, we know where most of the outbreaks are likely to occur. And we know ways to stop it."}, {"speaker": "Eryn Tong", "time": "25:51", "text": "But even within Canada, and I think Dr. Goel alluded to this, there are communities that are at greater risk, and that have potentially fewer resources, and so that we can very well plan for in advance and that is very much a public health concern, and also one that we need to take very seriously."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "26:08", "text": "Those are all excellent considerations. And just jumping off Eryn your last point, we've heard repeatedly that the COVID-19 pandemic has been shining a light on the inequities in our institutions. And across all of our discussions, our guests commented on the disproportionate impact of the virus on marginalized and racialized groups in particular. In our seventh episode, Eryn approached the pandemic through the lens of health equity to try and unpack some of these systemic underlying issues. Dr. Ceinwen Pope, a guest on this episode and medical resident in the University of Toronto's Public Health and Preventive Medicine program summarized this idea perfectly. "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ceinwen Pope", "time": "26:42", "text": "There are these underlying health inequities, meaning there are differences in health outcomes between different groups of people that are unfair and systemic in nature. And so by breaking it down that way, different levels of exposure, different levels of susceptibility and severe disease, and different levels of the way you're treated after the disease, you can see very clearly how all of these systems of inequality that are underlying our society are contributing to exacerbation of COVID-19, and why they're being concentrated in these groups."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "27:21", "text": "So Eryn, you hosted this stream. What did you take away from your conversation?"}, {"speaker": "Eryn Tong", "time": "27:25", "text": "So I think we had an incredibly long and fruitful discussion with Dr. Pope that we just heard from, as well as Dr. Roberta Timothy. And I think the main thing that was just very clear is that, you know, inequities and systemic racism are so deeply rooted within our colonial societal structures and they impact the health outcomes of black, indigenous racialized, marginalized communities within our entire history up to present day. We also discussed in the episode this term of \"syndemics\", which is the idea that there's essentially two pandemics that are happening parallel. One is of COVID, of course, and the parallel pandemic is of inequality. And I think that that really resonated and stuck with me."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "28:09", "text": "Echoing the point Dr. Pope made about how different levels of exposure and susceptibility can affect health outcomes. Dr. Jeff Kwong, program leader of the Populations and Public Health program at ICES, expanded on this in Episode Four."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jeff Kwong", "time": "28:22", "text": "I think it boils down to two factors. I think it boils down to workplaces and housing, you know, think of where do we spend most of our time either at work or at home. And so I think it's not as much about, you know, visible minority groups and immigrants as much as where people are working and where people are living, and that these workplaces may be unsafe for them. So if you're able to work from home, then that's, you know, a much safer environment. But if you have to go out to work, and you're potentially exposed to the virus, so a lot of the people who had to continue working through this pandemic, you know, were at risk of exposure. And a lot of these people were visible minorities and immigrants. You know, there are jobs such as, like personal support workers and nursing homes, or they work in, you know, food processing facilities. So these are just some examples where they may be working in close contact with others, they either don't have access to personal protective equipment, or they don't have training on how to use it, and then they're going home, where there may be a crowded living conditions. So there may be um, many people living in an apartment or in a house, you know, multi-generational families, where it would be hard to maintain physical distancing with others. And so then they introduced the virus into the household and it spreads to the household, and maybe one of the other people in that household also has to go to work and then they bring it to their workplace and so on and so forth. This was how we were seeing it spread in March and April and May."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "29:55", "text": "As the host of this livestream, Nathan, what did you take away from the discussion with your guests?"}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "30:00", "text": "You know, I found it actually really comforting to hear this being explained, this association between COVID and marginalized communities. I think very early on, there was a really legitimate worry that certain communities, immigrants, for whatever reason, black people, Chinese people were at a disproportionate risk of negative outcomes from COVID. So for example, I remember very early on, there was a study that was talking about how Chinese people or East Asians have higher levels of ACE-2 receptors in their lungs, and therefore might be at greater susceptibility. And so, now seeing that kind of research come up very early, it was hard to kind of contextualize and understand and basically say, like, is this a real effect? And then kind of since then, we've now seen a lot more research come out, and it's actually no, you know, certain races, for example, are not actually more susceptible because of something about their race, per se. It's rather about how their identities interact with social determinants of health, and how the social determinants of health themselves are disproportionately affect certain communities."}, {"speaker": "Eryn Tong", "time": "31:03", "text": "That reminds me of a quote, which is that race in and of itself is not the risk factor, it's racism. And I think, you know, having these conversations and bringing all of these issues to light are so important for all of our understandings and, and learnings moving forward."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "31:18", "text": "And you know, in Episode Two, Dr. Sharmistha Mishra, infectious disease physician and mathematical modeler at St. Michael's Hospital, told us about how COVID-19 transmission models are accounting for these different levels of risk and support, and why these data are so important."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Sharmistha Mishra", "time": "31:33", "text": "So it's becoming inevident in how the epidemic has evolved, thinking about congregate settings, whether you know, fixed or due to social constructs that limit physical distancing, for example, or limited with respect to infection prevention control practices, and supports a priori or before the outbreak. And so that that led to um, increased transmission. So thinking about those elements, and particularly those, that level of heterogeneity with onward transmission, because that will influence not just for casting down the road, particularly when we get closer to an R of one, you know, we really fluctuate according to sort of these heterogeneities. But second, is just from an intervention perspective, you know, sort of this one size, shoe fits all approach, where we just reduce one element of our equation, and with these contact rate, could apply very differently across if there is actual heterogeneity, both because the baseline risks might be different, but also because access to interventions and testing and supports might also be different. So heterogeneity, and risk, heterogeneity and access and, or inequities really, could sort of continue to drive transmission, which we might miss out on if we don't think about that in our transmission model. That's not to say every transmission model has to have it. But if one of our questions is, you know, what role does heterogeneity play? What interventions? How do we distribute interventions? What do we need to think about for protecting vulnerable populations or facilitating support so that we reduce transmission across vulnerable populations and settings? Then we need to be thinking about that in our transmission model mechanistically."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "33:16", "text": "Jesse as the host for the discussion with Dr. Mishra, can you unpack that clip for us?"}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "33:21", "text": "Yeah, so it gets back to some kind of fundamental theories in epidemic modeling that honestly are like two decades or more old, is some really early research basically showed that even just a small kind of core group, and sometimes that framing is even problematic, because it attributes kind of a responsibility of that group on an individual level that we try to avoid. But you know, the role of a core group in kind of, it's most important to reach them with the interventions, because if you don't, then epidemic can kind of smolder. And if you were to measure the epidemiological characteristics that might facilitate transmission outside that core group, you'd say, oh, this epidemic is going to die out on its own. But if you haven't kind of collected data on that group, and also simulated them appropriately in the model, and then use that infor- information to prioritize interventions to them, you may assume that some intervention that is kind of generic and applied to the whole population might solve the epidemic. And it really isn't sufficient for those key populations."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "34:18", "text": "And on the topic of data, and in response to the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black and Indigenous communities, there's been ongoing discussion about collecting race-based and socioeconomic data. There are definitely benefits and limitations of collecting this information and our guests on the seventh livestream touched on this. Here's Dr. Roberta Timothy, director of Health Promotion at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Roberta Timothy", "time": "34:41", "text": "You want the data to be able to do real active change work. And it needs to be done by people who are experiencing the violence and people who have done research in this area, people who already know how to do amazing programming, right, and want the data to kind of, the data is used to, to show what we already know, that there's this disparities and hopefully can create programs that can change disparities, including responsibility and accountability from the government. The government needs to be accountable for health disparities and public health, health disparities in this province and to change so the data should be able to be used to do so. So it's not data for data, don't collect data for data. We're collecting data to create equitable change, and health equity programs for people who have been exploited and violated within the system."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "35:28", "text": "Eryn, can you walk us through the pros and cons of collecting race-based data that you discuss with your guests?"}, {"speaker": "Eryn Tong", "time": "35:33", "text": "All of this is very much needed. There are also various risks to collecting this type of data, which we definitely discussed more in depth in the episode. Part of this risk involves the misuse or misinterpretation of the data that can help to perpetuate racism, or discrimination if the data is not owned and collected properly, by Black Indigenous health researchers as well. And, you know, it kind of touches on what Dr. Timothy highlighted um, within the clip, which is that we can't just collect data for data, it needs to be tied with intervention and resource development. And we also need to hold the government accountable in these endeavors. Quantitative data really can't capture or reflect the humanity behind people that are most deeply affected. And this can only be done through sharing the stories and continuous learning of the people that are actually affected."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "36:24", "text": "As you just touched on, Eryn, one of the disadvantages of race-based data collection is that it cannot capture the stories and provide the context behind the numbers.

And I think in some respect, the virus was the straw that broke the camel's back, because we were already as a vulnerable community, we were already coping with so many other issues, right, in terms of, you know, social exclusion, all the other social factors. And then we had, you know, what was going on in terms of, you know, the racial tensions and the the trauma resulting from that, right. So in terms of her own of the mental health impact, it was an added factor for us, right. We also, a lot of us started to experience the racial stress, racial trauma, and the racial battle fatigue that came with that, right. Because we, yes, we're in the middle of the pandemic, but like, one of my coworker would say, racism didn't go into quarantine. Right. And so even in Toronto, where you see there were presence of nooses in certain environments, right. And so, you know, that's why I say that to a lot of us, it's cumulative. Right? And so the impact and the community, and I can't speak obviously, for the for the entire community. But I think, you know, in general, that you know, a lot of us it's, it's, yes, it's the it's the COVID related anxiety, but it's also the racial trauma that we were dealing with. It's that oppression. So it's so multifaceted and multi-layered, right, in terms of, of all the mental health issues, that that's been going on in general for the general population, but in particularly for, for the African diaspora. And the lack of control, you know, the lack of control that we, that some of us feel, so it's multilayered for us."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "38:34", "text": "I think another important aspect of this conversation on health equity in the time of COVID is the ability of groups to adapt to a crisis. Ch\u00fak Odenigbo, PhD student and director of Ancestral Services, of Future Ancestor Services, highlighted the need for systemic solutions to these systemic problems."}, {"speaker": "Ch\u00fak Odenigbo", "time": "38:51", "text": "So it's a systemic issue. So societal delegations getting angry with an individual because they're going out within that two week time frame. Additionally, going out, getting angry individuals because they're not wearing a mask ignores the fact that it's not that individual. It's a societal issue. And then we see the same thing again, climate change. I know we should be talking about difference with products brand, much to market, which exact same thing with curmudgeons were really angry about other person because they got a plastic bag from the shopping mall. They didn't bring it on the usable box. But what if their mother of four, a single mother of four, who just didn't have time to run home and grab a reusable bag, and reusable bags, like five bucks apiece. You know, if you're working two jobs to like, accommodate four kids, for that five bucks is important for you. It's all of these different things where we need to like have conversations about it [unclear audio...], do we actually have equal access to putting in place measures that protect the environment and protect ourselves in terms of COVID and disease resilience?"}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "39:51", "text": "I think Ch\u00fak brings up a lot of interesting and important points here. And this conversation really made me reflect on the individualistic and collectivist aspects of our society."}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "40:00", "text": "It's a balance in Canada, I think we're all willing to make these personal sacrifices on a short term basis, like social distancing, and, you know, sacrificing our social life and these sorts of things and wearing a mask. But when we're talking about the systemic level changes that we kind of heard about a minute ago, we're not, we're not really willing to make those changes, and you know, pay higher taxes, essentially, to fund the social programs that might solve some of these systemic issues, that's really gets a lot of pushback. And, and same thing with our dependence on energy resources. And, yeah, there's, there's certain things that we're not willing to give up. And so I think that really pushes back against this idea that we are a socialist kind of society."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "40:39", "text": "Absolutely. And while this pandemic has been devastating for much of the world, and we certainly do not want to make light of its impact, a theme that did come up throughout our discussions was the potential to use this opportunity to make those sustainable changes and to shake up the status quo. The pandemic has taken an incredible toll. And there's definitely a lot that we can learn on a scientific, societal and even personal level. And on that individual level, Dr. Timothy challenged us to reflect and critically examine our own roles within our society."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Roberta Timothy", "time": "41:10", "text": "Think about the people who are being impacted gravely within this context, and, and rethink how you're going to act. Unlearn and challenge what you think you know. The, the surveillance of Black folks and Indigenous folks by police need to be challenged, because it's something that is preventing people from leaving their house, it's something that is creating continued structural violence, and it does impact our health, and our health access. So policing and looking at how to change that is really critical. Decolonizing your ideologies and practices are also really important. And something I always say, how do you change yourself, we have to change the structural system, we have to also change ourselves. So what is your accountability for the next steps?"}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "41:54", "text": "And so jumping off of that clip, what changes have you been trying to implement? And how are you keeping yourselves accountable? As the host of this conversation, Eryn, maybe we'll start with you."}, {"speaker": "Eryn Tong", "time": "42:04", "text": "I think in general, the period of this pandemic has definitely allowed and afforded a lot of time for self reflection in many areas of my personal life. But I think a big part of this reflection has also been taking time to reflect on my own biases and assumptions and ideologies. And especially as dialogue surrounding COVID health inequities, and as BLM ramped up, I think that all of these conversations within myself, but also with people around me, are very much needed. And just having sort of those candid and open discussions about, you know, how we look at the world and how we respond to the world, I think are just so important in terms of personal accountability. And so yeah, I think in general, it's just been a really excellent and much needed time for reflection."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "42:52", "text": "And building off of that, in terms of changes that I've been trying to implement, and echoing Eryn, as well, is that taking the time and prioritizing, just educating myself. There's a wealth of resources out there that are continually being added to. I've definitely been taking the time to explore these. And I encourage our listeners to as well."}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "43:11", "text": "Yeah, and I think that's so important, especially because one of the themes that's come out of these conversations, I think, has been how exhausting it can be to be asked about how you can help if you're, you know, part of these groups who are racialized and marginalized. And so, you know, at some point is not your responsibility, and other people have, should go and do the work themselves before relying on you to kind of tell them how to think or how to feel. Also, I did want to mention that as a podcast, we had taken some time to reflect on these things and examine some resources and had some training. And one of the outputs from that has been for the first time a code of conduct, which basically is going to encapsulate our commitment to representing issues of racialization and marginalization in the content, and also in the guests of our podcast, and also obviously maintaining a really inclusive and positive space as a community."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "44:00", "text": "So as everyone's been mentioning, the pandemic has allowed for a lot of time for self-reflection and connection as Dr. Rima Styra, Associate Professor of Psychiatry at U of T and guest on episode three reminded us."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Rima Styra", "time": "44:11", "text": "A lot of altruism that we've actually seen in the community where people cared about each other, and they were concerned about each other. They wanted to protect themselves, but they also wanted to protect others. And it would be really nice to see this kindness and caring, moving forwards, as time goes on. I also think that there's been a lot of self-reflection by people. And one of the big things that I think's happened is that people have a sense of gratitude as well. That we've been able to move forwards, but realize that there are many, many things that we still need to change and that we need to look at the positives, but also to look at the fact that there are many, many opportunities for us to improve at this point."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "44:55", "text": "And in our fifth livestream, we discussed the intersection between the pandemic and the climate change crisis. Now it feels like a lifetime ago, but climate change was actually named the most pressing political issue at the last Canadian election. In reflecting on the parallels between the global responses to the COVID crisis and climate crisis, Gideon Forman, climate change policy analyst at the David Suzuki Foundation raised some very helpful lessons that we have learned from the COVID crisis that can be used to help address the climate crisis as well."}, {"speaker": "Gideon Forman", "time": "45:23", "text": "I mean, I think we have to be careful against you know, what I would call sort of silver lining, I mean, some, some of the commentary that's coming out of the pandemic, in the environmental movement is always, isn't it wonderful that we're, you know, seeing these improvements in things like air pollution. I think the first thing to say is that the pandemic is a terrible tragedy, full stop. It's been horrific for people around the world. And it's, and we're not finished with it yet. So we have to acknowledge that, first and foremost. It is quite extraordinary how we have adjusted the fact that we're flying much less, the fact that we're working from home so much more. That is all, I think, rather hopeful, because it shows that we could make big changes that could also address the climate crisis. It shows that we can work and drive less. It shows that we can have business meetings and fly less, right. And we can do it very quickly if we have to. So I think that's one of the key lessons is that we can, we can make big changes quickly if we need to as a society. I think the other thing that comes out of COVID, in terms of a lesson is that we have to listen to the scientists. I mean, when we look back on the early days of COVID, what came up again and again, was that our public health professionals, our medical officers of health, who after all, are scientists, first and foremost, they were taking charge. And in most cases in Canada, we were listening to them, right. They were telling our mayors and our premiers and our federal government what to do, and in large measure, the politicians listen to them. And on the climate crisis, likewise, we have to listen to our scientists, right? Our scientists are saying, our best scientists are saying we have to make dramatic reductions in our greenhouse gas emissions within the decade. And then finally, I think another lesson coming out of COVID is that if we want to we can work internationally, across silos in a quite non-partisan way. And I think we were seeing this in Canada as well. We're putting differences aside and working in a non-partisan way for the betterment of public health."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "47:24", "text": "Do you think the lessons that Gideon mentioned can be successfully implemented in our efforts to address the climate change crisis? Nathan, maybe we can start with you."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "47:31", "text": "So I think Gideon kind of hits it on the head here that, you know, when the need to take collective action appears, humans on Earth are able to do this. And we, I think it's the first time I think we to ourselves confirmed that we were able to do this was during uh, you know, in the late 90s and early 2000s, this whole ozone hole that was appearing in our atmosphere, and then all the actions that were taken to remove CFCs from all of the devices and refrigerators, etcetera, that were using them. So I think that, you know, there's this proof of concept that, yes, we can take action together, and that we can take action on something like the climate. This is something that is possible for us."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "48:11", "text": "I think that's a great point, um, but I think another point that Gideon also touches on is that one of the problems with the ozone layer, that was amazing how we tackled that, but after that there was the perception that, oh, we had solved the problem. And that we can move on and that we don't really necessarily need to worry about the other problems that need to be tackled related to climate change. So I think an important aspect as well, is to kind of maintain that momentum."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "48:38", "text": "I will say a lot of this is very related to the time horizon of the issue, right? For more immediate issues, we have a lot more will. And I think that does cloud some of our judgment, because climate change isn't stopping. And we've seen this year has been one of the hottest years on record, we have the ice caps melting. And like you can't stop any of this without drastic action. As we heard, climate change is a huge topic for the elections. And now, it's completely overshadowed. And many regulations have been overturned, to help industry and help the economy. And while that's important, I think we also have to keep in mind that climate change isn't going anywhere. And we still need those regulations."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "49:28", "text": "I guess I'll also add on to that too, because I like how you bring up time horizons and that, you know, the problem with the ozone layer was a very short time horizon. We could see this happening, it was deteriorating, we could tell what the agent was causing and then we could address the issue. With SARS, it was, it was kind of a bit of a like, you know, a drill for a pandemic. But at the same time, you know, same thing. It was a very immediate issue and we were able to deal with it very quickly. What's interesting about climate change is that it's you're right it's very long term. It's on a decade's long scale. And what's interesting about COVID then, is that it sits kind of an in between, between the short time horizons and extremely long time horizons. So I think this, in part will be a really interesting test for our society. Can we deal with at least a midterm issue, and deal with it successfully? And maybe that will give us more hope, then for something like a longer term issue, like climate change."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "50:23", "text": "Just bouncing off that, the difference between COVID and climate change is also the outcomes are much more visible and quantifiable for COVID. Like you have people not getting infected, people are living longer that do get infected. Versus with climate change, it's it's gonna be a slow, gradual, very, dragged out process, right. Also not to get very political, but there's no political will there to look out for people 2050 years in the future."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "50:54", "text": "One last point, I just want to bring up in terms of, at the beginning of the pandemic, we thought that perhaps a positive aspect would be that there would be these decreases in carbon emissions because of this change of behavior. But I think we definitely need to be careful about that, and not kind of over emphasizing that, because one, in the end, the carbon emissions, the change is not really enough to kind of eradicate the impact of our behavior, up until this point. As well, secondly, we don't really know, or we're just kind of beginning to learn how the second wave of handling the pandemic is going to impact the environment."}, {"speaker": "Eryn Tong", "time": "51:33", "text": "And I think just tying together all of what we've just discussed, the outcomes of COVID are a lot more tangible, and we see it. We, all of us know of some person that's been affected, whether that's yourself or a family member, or a friend. Whereas with climate change, you know, you really aren't able to see those immediate outcomes, and therefore, the impetus for self accountability to, you know, create sustainable change, I think it's going to be a lot more difficult. And we've already experienced that with the climate crisis."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "52:01", "text": "So I think a lot of excellent points were brought up. And I would definitely encourage everyone to listen to the full discussion on the topic of climate change and COVID. But our guest had a lot to say, on the intersection of these two crises. So the entire COVID decoded series was a really big undertaking for our team and a first for the podcast. And it was an incredible learning opportunity. And for me, at least, it was a nice, weekly constant to have throughout this pandemic. We've talked a lot today about our own reflections on the discussions that we had, but I wanted to pose one final question to all of you hosts. What was something you've learned about yourself and how you've coped throughout the pandemic? Grace, can you start us off?"}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "52:42", "text": "Sure. So I think there have been a number of things that I've learned. So first, I feel like we can all relate to kind of suddenly being pretty isolated from your community. Definitely, kind of taught me a lot of gratitude for the relationships in my life, for my family, for just those regular interactions. Also my lab as well. Those regular interactions that I just suddenly had to really work a lot harder to maintain. Secondly, one of the things I've learned kind of is completely switching my working environment from my lab, and often coffee shops, to my home, was a really interesting experience. And I think kind of being able to wake up in the morning and control every aspect of my day in terms of, in terms of where I was and my time spent, and how I organize my day, I had a lot more control over that. Being able to wake up every day and kind of control your day and your environment a lot more than you necessarily would, before the pandemic kind of gave me an opportunity to think a bit more and learn a bit more about my strengths and weaknesses. What makes me productive, how I kind of manage my energy."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "53:48", "text": "That's great. Yagnesh, what about you?"}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "53:51", "text": "I learned how loud my neighbours are. Right when I have to work. More seriously, though, I will say I went through a lot of emotions, when this first started. Um, a lot of it is because I'm an international student, so my family is not in the country. There's a bit of anxiety there. Like my mom's a doctor, so she has to go deal with some of these uh high-risk populations, so it's just something that's always in the back of your mind, um... It's not something you can do anything about. I have started calling them more often, which is nice. We chat more. I'll definitely take that with me going forward.

So about April. And I as a self-proclaimed introvert did not really feel the same need to see people I guess? Like I was so happy working from home and just hermitting and was, but like, you know, coming around June, or like early July, I think it finally got to me then like, you know, it took me the better part of three months. Yes, introverts can actually get cabin fever and like desire to seek social interaction at some point eventually. But yeah, I, I learned that about myself that I actually, from time to time may actually seek social interaction."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "55:27", "text": "And Jesse, how about you?"}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "55:28", "text": "Yeah, I just want to echo that point about being an introvert, there was that meme going around, like, Oh, this is quarantine? This is just my day-to-day life. But uh, you know, I am, I have been privileged as well, like living with my girlfriend here in Kingston and also, there's been some other people in the house, her sister and everything. So, you know, reflecting on the privilege to, to have those social interactions, whereas you know, some people literally living alone, I think this would be especially,x especially hard on them. And then the other thing that I'm especially appreciative of is just how fragile our way of life is, when you, when you think about public transit and enjoying social outings or even shopping at bulk barn, like I really avoided the waste with that. So that's been a little bit hard to transition away from, but like Gideon said, you know, talking about things that we've learned from this um, the fact that we can make these huge systemic changes, is is kind of inspiring, and hopefully, we can make the most out of that."}, {"speaker": "Ekaterina An", "time": "56:23", "text": "And finally, Eryn?"}, {"speaker": "Eryn Tong", "time": "56:24", "text": "Yeah, I think the biggest theme that you know, all of you have touched on is really just gratitude, I think, feeling so grateful for having a roof over my head, for healthy family, healthy friends, to be able to have the privilege to work from home, to have a job, to have the technology available to be able to connect with friends and family remotely. And I think maybe just one thing to finish this off is that I'm just also so grateful for this incredible team, um, that is our podcast team. I have honestly been so impressed by the way that we've all pulled together to create this incredible livestream series. Honestly, I don't think any of our listeners or any of our audience will know the amount of details and stress that we have overcome and that we have sorted out.

But I had the unusual experience of having much younger siblings who were born at home with a midwife. And so I didn't really know that you did something else other than have a midwife when you're going to have a baby. And I didn't realize  until my first midwifery appointments, that the fact that my mom has had it midwifery care in the 90s was actually surprising and really cool. And so for me, it wasn't really a question. If I wanted a midwife. The question was, which clinic I wanted to end up with. And we ended up taking the midwifery clinic that was the closest to our house, and it was the most positive health care experience I have had in my whole life."}, {"speaker": "Mom 2", "time": "1:01", "text": "I think for me, I'm a pretty cautious person.

So I, I didn't really consider alternatives. I didn't really consider having a midwife or anything like that, because my comfort level was really being in the hospital. And I think for me, I would still still have the babies in the hospital. And I think for each one of them, I felt like I was really well taken care of, and that the baby is really well taken care of. And I'm glad that I made the decision that I made."}, {"speaker": "Mom 3", "time": "1:45", "text": "Yeah, so I saw a family doctor at Mount Sinai, they have a family medicine team there.

And so they offered information on like, pain management during labour. And yeah, it was really a great program. And that's sort of where I, I established my birth plan, excuse me, so to speak. And I also found using online resources really helpful. So there was like a website, I frequented a lot when I was pregnant, called www.babycenter.ca and you just create an account and you post anonymously, if you have any questions about labour, like anything that happens, you know, post-labor with your baby. And I found, it was really nice to get like unbiased opinions from ultimately like total strangers at times. And it can be sometimes more helpful, I think then asking like friends and family, because its own bias. So that helps a lot with establishing your birth plan for me as well, just going online and seeing what other people had to say.

And then the couple's group, it was very serious and intense. And everyone was very keen, they wanted to plan their births. And so we spent a lot of time discussing what was the ideal birth. And in those days, this is back in the early 90s, there was pressure to have a natural birth, whatever that meant to avoid drugs, if you could, and to breastfeed and all of these things. And so I guess, I had an idea in my mind, which is that I would like to minimize drugs if I could. So those were the hopes that I had, it would be going into hospital didn't have a problem with that for the first for the other for the second baby. I was okay about going into hospital, having had a, you know, a fairly positive experience first time.

And so I mean, we plan a homebirth, I wanted our little one to be born at home in an environment, I guess that I felt that I could kind of control and plan for and prepare. I didn't like the idea of being in a hospital. But with our team of midwives, I felt really safe. I may felt like I was still in control."}, {"speaker": "Madeleine Springate-Combs", "time": "4:57", "text": "I feel like I am super was and am super lucky because going into pregnancy, I already knew so much about it. As a midwife, I love attending homebirths. And for low-risk women without complications, I think they're a great option. I think that women pay to have their babies wherever they're gonna be the most comfortable, where there's going to be the least amount of stress, and that will help a labour progress, there's less stress hormones, then there is more oxytocin, which is the hormone that causes contractions and labour. So if a woman has a home that is going to freak her out, then she should be in the hospital, that's great, she's gonna feel like the right, yes, she knows that's where she's gonna feel calm. And like, that's the right place for her, for me that was that was at home."}, {"speaker": "Mom 1", "time": "5:48", "text": "But once we were home, we had really regular both phone checkings with our midwifery team, and also in person visits.

They are a primary health care provider, specifically for women and babies. So women for the length of their pregnancy, for the labour, the delivery and then they continue to be primary care provider for the mom and the baby for the first six weeks of the baby's life."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "8:36", "text": "In Ontario, a women can elect to have either a midwife as their primary care provider or a physician such as an obstetrician-gynecologist or family doctor, followed by a pediatrician to look after the baby post-birth under OHIP, either are covered but not both."}, {"speaker": "Madeleine Springate-Combs", "time": "8:52", "text": "Okay, so other I guess differences between midwifery and a doctor, a midwife is an expert in, in normal pregnancy, normal situations, healthy pregnancy, normal deliveries, when things go outside of that the midwife consult with a physician or, you know, appropriate other caregiver. Basic example: a midwife doesn't do a c-section. So, and I think some of your questions will get to those later, but if a women need the  c-section that is a temporary transfer of care to an obstetrician to perform the surgery. But then care of the baby and care of the mom would be transferred back to the midwife when  it is appropriate. Other differences with midwifery and the medical model is like more kind of philosophical, but that also leads to differences in what it looks like."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "9:43", "text": "Madelyn alluded to several specific philosophies that midwives have, we asked her what those philosophies were and how they guide midwives practices."}, {"speaker": "Madeleine Springate-Combs", "time": "9:50", "text": "So midwifery in Ontario is based on three main philosophies. So one of those is choice of birth place. And so midwives offer women a choice of a birthplace so you can have your baby in the hospital, you can have your baby at home, or if there is one, you can have your baby in a birth center. So the second philosophy is informed choice. The medical equivalent would be informed consent, which is great, but how I think about it is informed consent is saying: \"This is a procedure that we're going to do, do you agree to it? Whereas informed choice is saying: These are your options, let's talk about it. What do you want to do?\" Spend more open ended. And I get what that how that changes the practice of midwifery is that our appointments are a lot longer, a general visit with a midwife is 30 minutes to 45 minutes, which would be which is considerably longer than you would generally get with an obstetrician or a family doctor. That gives us a time to talk about what your options are in pregnancy, to talk about the different tests that are available, and really let women make their their choice. And we really respect that it's the family's decisions when it comes to the, you know, interventions that are offered in pregnancy. That said, we do offer all the same testing. Third philosophy is continuity of care. So generally, when a woman comes into care with a midwifery practice, they're kind of teamed with a small team of midwives. And those midwives get to know the woman so the woman will only see those that small team and it is extremely likely that one of those midwives that the woman knows, will be at her birth, not only at her birth, but at her whole, like active labour, birth and immediate postpartum. So essentially, what that looks like in the labour and delivery room is that the midwife is doing the role of the nurse and the doctor. And then in the postpartum, it's awesome that women have a person that they have had a relationship with, and they know and trust that actually does home visits. In the first few weeks postpartum."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "11:57", "text": "Madeline talked us through what care from a midwife might look like. We wondered what other types of health care professionals a midwife might collaborate with and under what types of situations that might occur."}, {"speaker": "Madeleine Springate-Combs", "time": "12:07", "text": "So we'll collaborate with a variety of specialties, whoever is most appropriate. So like I mentioned, maybe we'll be working with or consulting with your family physician, if there's like a pre-existing condition, the care provider we're consulting with the most often is obstetricians. But then also pediatricians because we're also taking care of the baby for the first six weeks of their life. So if there's a complication, and then we be consulting with the pediatrician,"}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "12:33", "text": "While expectant moms can elect to have midwife care for them and their baby instead of a physician Madeline mentioned that in cases of high risk pregnancies, a midwife would transfer care to an OBGYN. We spoke to Dr. John Kingdom, a physician at Mount Sinai Hospital here in Toronto specializing in placental complications and high-risk pregnancies. We first asked him about the work done at the Ontario Fetal Center and High-risk Pregnancy Clinic."}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Kingdom", "time": "12:57", "text": "There's two parts to high-risk pregnancy care. One is maternal complications of pregnancy. The other one is all the range of fetal diagnosis. So we cover all fetal anomalies and all that sort of common perinatal problems like ruptured membranes, bleeding,  placenta previa, twins, short cervix, all that sort of stuff. Then we do all the inocula normally diagnosis and management. And then we have two separate things. One is preterm-birth prevention. The other one is placental complications, which are medical ones and surgical ones. And fetal includes fetal therapy, so you know, interventions before birth, to try and improve the outcomes for say, twins with twins-twin transfusion syndrome, or certain kinds of fetal abnormalities, including surgery for fetal spina bifida, but that program had to be stopped during covid. But all the other programs are running, running quite normal, you do have to be referred and you want to have at least a reasonable reason to come. So we have a filtering system, we have a triage system, we can get 50, 60 referrals a day, so we can't see 50, 60 people per day. And if we have to pick, pick who we're going to see so someone will get disappointed or do we can give advice, we can you know, write advice out back to the referring midwife or doctor. I mean, a lot of the elements of good care require collaboration with surgeons and oncologists and other people. So, you know, a lot of it's very interdisciplinary care."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "14:20", "text": "As Dr. Kingdom alluded to earlier, complications arising during pregnancy don't just originate from the maternal side, but also the fetal side."}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Kingdom", "time": "14:28", "text": "So we we have specialty clinics at Sinai with the key people who are at the sick kids, so you know, we would work with sick kids and the really the three areas, those three areas in particular, to get the accurate diagnosis, look for associated abnormalities, and then talk about prognosis, and decide do you want to continue the pregnancy, plan the delivery and go to Sickkids or do you want a termination of pregnancy? That\u2019s the general you know, pathway of how we manage patients with fetal abnormalities, you know, major fetal abnormalities. Of course, every pregancy is screen for major fetal abnormalities with the 19 to 20 week anatomy ultrasound, and their screen for common chromosome abnormalities using first semester screening and NIPT."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "15:13", "text": "Given the large range of cases seen at the clinic, we asked Dr. Kingdom to describe the approach he uses to deal with some common conditions. Dr. Kingdom also spoke about their approach in cases where mothers face mental health problems and the potential side effect of any medications."}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Kingdom", "time": "15:28", "text": "So in terms of common conditions, I mean, an accurate screening and diagnosis and management of preeclampsia, which is nuancing hypertension in pregnancy and fetal growth restriction due to placental disease, we have better and better tools to do those things well, and their everyday common problems. The diagnosis and management of fetal abnormalities is a pretty efficient process now. Fetal therapy for a number of conditions as well established like, for example, prevention and treatment of research disease is well established. The accurate diagnosis and delivery and management of congenital heart disease is fairly well established. So we're getting better at screening and diagnosis of that. We also have a program in pregnancy for people who become pregnant with a prior ongoing significant mental health diagnosis, particularly in the major mood disorders. Of course, they could have a concurrent disorder, they could have an addiction associated with a major mood disorder. I mean, you can get neonatal withdrawal from SSRIs and SNRIs at a sort of staged 123. So stage one withdrawal is subtle, but would be recognized by, you know, a trained physician and or a nurse. And the parents wouldn't necessarily be aware, you know, so I mean, full blown withdrawal and seizures are really uncommon. So most people are recommended to remain on their mood stabilizer drugs, during pregnancies, the benefits of stability greatly outweigh any risks."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "16:53", "text": "We were curious to hear about complicated cases, those where much is still unknown, how do they approach such cases?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Kingdom", "time": "17:00", "text": "Okay, so with very complex cases, you registries is one way forward, and it can be done internationally. So UK, for example, has a registry for rare diseases. And they basically picked 10 a year, and they just sort of ordered them for a year and a country in a population of 50 million people. So, you know, for example, at our hospital, we will you know, we've had 10 cases in 20 years of disease x and we'll do a systematic review meta analysis of the cases and present that publish that. So it's our way forward. observational studies are the norm in many areas of prenatal diagnosis and treatment. But we have had, you know, successful international randomized control trials for rare conditions like say surgery for fetal spinal Bifida. The nastiest problem with the least understanding is for sure, spontaneous preterm labor, ruptured membranes and deliver been 70% of all Singleton births, ending up in NICU are the results of spontaneous preterm labor and or and or ruptured membranes with no other known pathway. No underlying pathogenic explanations. So, you know, we're in our in our infancy for some of those things. Okay. Yeah. And they're very common. Yeah."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "18:13", "text": "So what are the main factors determining a woman's risk level when becoming pregnant,"}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Kingdom", "time": "18:18", "text": "Your previous reproductive history, performance, your previous medical and surgical history, your family history, all of these things are relevant. But I mean, we're not going to see them when they're not pregnant unless they're referred. So it's very much a primary care issue. And many women was a more and more aware of potential risk by being pregnant. But it's amazing how many will, you know, get pregnant in quite treacherous circumstances without any previous pregnancy consultation, the best example of that is IVF in women that are very overweight, right? So there's a big push to try and get women to have IVF clinics to not do this. And so people have pre-pregnancy consultations to go over the implications of being pregnant when in a high BMI, BMI category, certainly BMI over 40. But there are many women attending our hospital with BMI over 50. In fact, 50 is a cutoff. Because we have so many high high BMI patients. So we don't see anybody for that reason unless their BMI as above 50. But I mean, people are getting pregnant from my private IVF clinics and carrying a lot of significant comorbidities without necessarily having had a pre-pregnancy consult. So what we do at Sinai is we have a direct link between the Sinai fertility and then Maternal Fetal Medicine, both pre-pregnancy for consultation then when they are pregnant, they seamlessly move from the RER division to one of our MFM members who specializes in pregnancy care for infertile patients, because they're much more likely to have potential complications, for example, as well."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "19:48", "text": "As you might have gathered from the discussion so far on the type and magnitude of cases seen at Mount Sinai. It really is one of the top centers for maternal and fetal medicine here in North America. Dr. Kingdom explains that the complexity of care delivered, number of rare cases seen, and caliber research conducted at Mount Sinai have made it a world leader in pregnancy care. In fact, despite their already full caseload Dr. Kingdom mentions that the center often receives referrals from patients from other countries who sometimes seek refugee status to obtain specialized care here."}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Kingdom", "time": "20:20", "text": "It\u2019s by far the biggest program of its kind anywhere in Canada, because there are 20 members of the MFM division including three geneticists. So of the seven and a half thousand deliveries a year here, 3000 will be clearly high risk. So we are the biggest volume hospital and the biggest volume highest pregnancy program by far, we will be in the top five in the world in terms of volume and specialization. Because we do, there's nothing there's nothing we don't do, right? We do all of fetal therapy, we do all the patients with cancer, organ transplantation, complex obstetric surgery. So in other hospitals in the GTA area would have MFM physicians, either working on their own or in smaller groups. So Sinai will always be that it will always be the number one in Canada because of the population in the GTA, and it's an it's in central Canada, opposite of the big Sickkids hospital so they get federal referrals. It's a federal MFM referral unit, basically. So people will come from all over Canada, particularly English speaking Canada, for treatment, you know, we have 10 Maternal Fetal Medicine fellows. And at any one time we've got we're turning a mix of Canadians plus a few from more of the world."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "21:33", "text": "Another important and often challenging time is the postpartum period, Dr. Kingdom spoke to us about the support provided to women at this critical time and the work being done to address challenges here through the summit program."}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Kingdom", "time": "21:45", "text": "So we actually have a division of perinatal psychiatry, but when access to perinatal psychiatry isn't swift and easy. So in the COVID area, it coincided with Sinai becoming the major site of a US study called summit, which is around scaling up online mental health support for women. And that's proven to be remarkably successful, because of course, people that's the only default pathway to support people in the COVID era. I mean, one in four, one in five patients in high risk pregnancy management will either have or need mental health co-care."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "22:20", "text": "The clinic has implemented telemedicine to address the problem of accessibility to maternal pregnancy care and a broader sense, not just postpartum services."}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Kingdom", "time": "22:29", "text": "Yeah, we're trying really hard to do that. We're, you know, to provide better outreach, and it isn't worth at all to travel, as opposed to getting a car and driving two hours north to  Orillia and back, you know, so we do a bit of telemedicine, but what we do is we triage really very well, we try and do definitive consultations in one go. And then we do shared care, and we keep people for delivery that we need to and we try hard to devolve care back again as much as we can. Because those are important points mean some of the hardest scripts to do with our, you know, young First Nations women on reserves, five hours north of here, you know, that they're, so they're a tough group, when actually it doesn't, they have, paradoxically, they have no financial cost because everything is fully covered by their band. So the uninsured, non non-native status people in very Northern Ontario, they're the ones who struggle because they'll get a northern travel grant, but it will cover only a small fraction of the cost of coming. But people do come six, eight hours, there are ways of getting around coming in to some extent, often as a substitute for imaging the patient yourself and talking to them eye to eye and having a good counseling session. You know, so do do as much interdisciplinary care on the same day as you possibly can."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "23:45", "text": "Given the need to make the most out of each visit, we ask Dr. Kingdom what the clinic strategy is to address this and the use of telemedicine to do so."}, {"speaker": "Show Host", "time": "23:53", "text": "Is there a battery of tests that you go through usually, just to make sure that some standard things are covered?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Kingdom", "time": "23:59", "text": "Well, often those things are all, most of the standard early testing is initiated by the primary health care provider which we can then see online. So we've that's the reason we formed what's known as the Ontario Fetal Center at Sinai. We received some government funding for that. So we have nurses that coordinate all those things. So if somebody is going to come from five hours north, we'll review the triage and we know what the likely diagnosis we might set up appointments B and C. So A is with us and then B and C to follow and to try and get as much done for them to decide to one termination of pregnancy Yes or no? What do I see the right people to get the prognosis so that we're making a decision to carry on it's as well informed as possible. It's way better to see people that are possible, because imaging is so important in fetal medicine and the maternal medicine patients are going to be our patients anyway. So telemedicine really works best for people who are more remote for an opinion. So there's a segment of people where it works well. It doesn't work uniformly well. I'll be honest. So The key point is constantly triage and recalibrating that so we're, we're looking at the thin end of the ice cream cone. So there's only so much work we can do. So we try and concentrate on the patients with the greatest probability benefit."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "25:15", "text": "After hearing about how complicated the cases scene at the clinic are we couldn't help but ask how collaborative the patients are when it comes to risk assessment and pregnancy management. So we asked Dr. Kingdom about his approach to patient counseling and his experience regarding the response."}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Kingdom", "time": "25:30", "text": "Um, somewhere in the middle, I mean, I think patients want doctors to give them an honest opinion, when there are there are circumstances where pregnancies a very treacherous to occur, for example, signs of congenital heart disease is one or you know, complex cancer that's really only metastatic. So our situations, you know, Surat, you know, cirrhotic liver disease, serious chronic lung disease, when there are situations we look someone in the eye and say you could get pregnant with a very, you know, limited chance of success, we could go one in three chance of dying, but the kind of person has a one three chance of dying, may see being pregnant as life affirming for them, and they really approach to that risk. But what they need is very compassionate, honest counseling, worsing is people who are, you know, desperate trying to be pregnant their late 40s, early 50s through donor egg IVF. But people are pregnant, much older and much more complicated situations than ever before, in ever increasing ever increasing numbers. And they're the things that that's that's where the wall of problems are. So all the stillbirths and hypertension and birth destruction all comes from that triad of diabetes, hypertension, advanced maternal age, IVF, that sort of mixture creates, you know, and metabolic syndrome creates all that general higher risk, which is why for example, today, despite modern technology, we still have a one in 200 to one and 300 stillbirth rate in the third trimester, despite the fact that the average pregnant woman has three or four ultrasounds. You know, so why is that? Well, the answer is that we still need to improve on our diagnostic on our screening precision for those conditions. And we need to be more more and more aggressive about late preterm delivery to prevent stillbirth. I mean, you know, pregnant for the first time to a baby over 40 is definitely a red flag, no question. But people don't want to believe they're getting older. So there's a difference between fitness and reproductive aging, reproductive age is a real phenomenon that people don't want to. They don't want to buy into it, you know."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "27:36", "text": "Dr. Kingdom emphasizes that he understands it's hard to reconcile the potential risks of getting pregnant at older ages with the opportunity to have a baby. There are so many reasons for why someone might put off pregnancy including waiting for the right partner, pursuing education, lack of economic stability, or potentially vulnerable housing situations. It's obviously a sensitive topic and one that requires much open and judgment-free discussion. As he alluded to just now, even when someone is physically very healthy at an older age, they still have significantly higher risk for complications, something that can be very difficult to accept."}, {"speaker": "Show Host", "time": "28:12", "text": "So in all your I know you've done this for a really long time.

He's an engineer, and I took them on as patients. And she had a little low PLGF. I gave her a heparin as well as aspirin. We watched her carefully, I put her into the hotel component of the hospital because she lived a long way away. And we dug the baby out by caeserean at 36 weeks, and I've got a very nice photo of mom, dad and the baby. And that was amazing.

Since then, she's been on five different missions in Ethiopia, Kenya, Yemen, Sierra Leone, and just recently returned from her second mission in Yemen, where she was providing rural maternal-newborn care in a conflict zone. I think when people think of Doctors Without Borders, they usually think of the doctors being the ones in the field or sometimes even nurses. I think nurses were involved in the original MSF when it was created. But midwives like when I heard that you were a midwife and were working with MSF. I didn't even realize that that was something that you could do or..."}, {"speaker": "Lauren Wadham", "time": "31:19", "text": "Yeah, I just think our understanding globally of the role of midwives is not very clear in the Canadian context. Like, in Canada midwive, I think most people already know this are doing about like 15% of obstetrical care delivery. But globally, midwives are like 90% of the workforce when it comes to obstetrical care. So like, it's it's part of like the UN mandate to increase skilled birth attendance globally. And that's mainly out of midwives, because nurses and midwives (this being the year of the nurse and the midwife - 2020). An..

Yeah, especially with COVID and everything that's happening and how nurses are so fundamental to what's like the progress. Yeah, it's amazing. So midwives globally are the first line workers for all the technical care, it's quite odd in our context for low risk women to be seeing high risk practitioners. So like globally, women are being seen by midwives, first line. So that being said, as an NGO, midwives going into these contexts to work with midwives makes more sense than a physician going in there to do that."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "32:39", "text": "Lauren also mentions that while half the staff are field workers, the other half of hired staff work in logistics, administration and operations, which provides the backbone of care delivery.

Because it just, it just makes sense. And I could go into that for hours about why that makes sense. But yes, like, at its core, the objective is for it to be a community based health care system. So like, when we go in there, we are very, very focused on acceptance, because without acceptance from the community, our work is very ineffective. So anthropologists, health promoters, field coordinators, will be going to the local religious leaders, so local community has the even like the females that are kind of like the main caregivers, before there was like, a functioning structural system, right. So a big part of that is going there and meeting with them and getting their blessing essentially, and saying like, are we providing what you need? And how can we do that? So that's like the ultimate goal. It's, it's very imperfect, for sure. But that's essentially what I'm trying to do. So coming in there, and building a strong community group of like, hired individuals that also like collaborative individuals is like the goal."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "34:14", "text": "Lauren, emphasize that well, MSF isn't perfect. They really do aim to foster community ties and acceptance in the locations they serve. The program can't work unless that trust is there. For context. She describes the situation in her most recent mission to Yemen, and how it differed from her previous mission there."}, {"speaker": "Lauren Wadham", "time": "34:33", "text": "It was really difficult because we felt like the patients, at one point were not coming to the hospital because of fear of getting COVID themselves at our facility, or because of misinformation that was being passed on about how COVID patients are being treated. And so we were finding that during especially the first I think April in the month of April, at the hospital I was working at which does about 1800 to 1000 deliveries a month, for the facility that we were, we had, which was very modest, we were probably having one of the lowest mortality rates I've ever seen in any of my contacts, like we were providing really high-quality care for what our context was, but then come COVID. And because patients weren't coming early enough, they were seeking care so late, or they were going to private clinics that didn't have the facilities that they needed, they would come to us very late. And we had some very poor outcomes and the highest mortality rate that we had seen for years, like my midwife that I was working with, we were just like shaking their head, not understanding why we were having so many women come and die, because of this, like perceived fear of the hospital that wasn't there before. And they had been working over the last five years, so hard to get accepted within the community. And for something like this pandemic, to really break all of that and just like have it all crumble down. So we thought, I think the hospital just before I left had really recovered in their like ability to help the population understand, and we were doing better health promotion. But like those three months, just a lot of harm to the population. Even in that short time, because of the perceived fear and inability to really promote what we're doing effectively."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "36:35", "text": "It's clear that the covid 19 pandemic has changed the experience of pregnancy and birth, both here in Canada and around the world. But that women in different countries are clearly affected in different ways. We asked Lauren to speak to maternal health care similarities and differences globally, how are outcomes different across the world?"}, {"speaker": "Lauren Wadham", "time": "36:54", "text": "So globally, I kind of think like all women fundamentally are seeking the same thing. They're seeking safety, dignity they're seeking a cultural appropriateness, traditional appropriateness. And at the most basic level, they're seeking not to be harmed in their health, whatever that means. Like, obviously, in the context I've worked in, that means like not dying, or not having a severe morbidity coming out of pregnancy related complications, which seems like very foreign to us, living in Canada. So like, just for numbers sake, just to kind of bring people's awareness. Like in the last couple of years, it's about like 800 women a day, globally are dying from preventable pregnancy related complications. So not just complications, but like preventable. And like, as a juxtaposition. In Canada, we on average, would have about eight out of 100,000 women a year, dying from those types of complications. Whereas when I worked in Sierra Leone, which has the highest maternal mortality rates, it's about 1300, per 100,000. So out of all of the 800 a day deaths that are preventable, 94 95% of those are happening in low or low to middle income countries. So when we're talking about global health, it's very basic, we kind of think of it in three main barriers. So one of the biggest barriers to women receiving good healthcare, life-saving health care, quality health care, is not even knowing about the service existing. And this can be because they're migrants, they're displaced, they don't have access to consistent electricity to be able to receive like a WhatsApp message. Or there's no good health promotion from the government or from an NGO in the region for them to be aware of what they can access. So like, that's the basic is like the knowledge of the service isn't even there. And then the second barrier is the ability to get to the service. So once she knows about the service, what is her ability to get to the service? What are those barriers, so that could be lack of finances, a cultural inability to move, like when I was in Yemen, women tend not to move without a male caretaker, or the middle of the night, there's not taxis running close to where she is. So she has to wait till the morning we had a few of those or they came in very late to care not because she didn't want to seek that care, but because she didn't have access to transportation until the morning, these types of things. And then the fourth is the quality service itself. So maybe she knows about the service, maybe she can get to the service. But then the actual facility is a rural health post that doesn't have a nurse it only has a nurse assistant or doesn't have laboratory services or doesn't have a blood bank. Or she can't access antenatal care because there's not a midwife there, like, the services themselves are not quality. So we kind of in developmental aid and things like this are kind of focusing on how do we get those three things to line up. And then even when we get all of those things to line up, which in itself feels like a big job, then how do we make that healthcare, a healthcare that's sensitive to the patient's specific story and journey? And how do we provide a healthcare system that takes into consideration the traditional medicine that she might value and think is part of that normal pregnancy? Like, how do we put those together? So that's like another level that I think we struggle with on a day to day basis within health care globally, especially when international people are coming into those contexts. So those are like a very basic level are the barriers, let alone all the other things that we deal with in Canada that we do know are real barriers, but then just to kind of get those basic ones out of the way is a struggle in itself in some of these contexts."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "41:06", "text": "Lauren discussed some of the barriers to care for expectant moms in developing countries. MSF tries to address each of these barriers by hiring local, supporting transportation costs for patients, and engaging in health promotion, through radio, whatsapp and Facebook. So in addition to all the amazing work that you've done with MSF, you also work here in Canada as a midwife. And you mentioned that you provide some relief care in rural areas of Canada, such as Nunavut, we often think of disparities in maternal health as like, as you mentioned, many of the deaths related to maternal health happened in the developing world. But like in Canada, there are also disparities in care in rural and remote areas. So can you talk a little bit about your work in Nunavut and some of the inequities in access to care and how that exists there?"}, {"speaker": "Lauren Wadham", "time": "41:59", "text": "Yeah, yeah. I'm glad you're touching upon this, because I think we really other countries that need help, and we don't realize how, how much our own system has to change. So my role in working in the north, has been for mostly like coverage and relief, because of a major problem of them not having enough staff to cover the health health clinics up there. Because ideally, I shouldn't be going there. Ideally, it should be local midwives, just in the same way that like, globally, ideally, I shouldn't have to go to these other countries, right."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "42:40", "text": "Lauren explains that there's a lack of providers for the Inuit communities living in Nunavut. In fact, there are only three and you add midwives for the whole territory, with just a handful of non-Inuit midwives and the rest coming from southern Canada for relief work like herself. The Inuit are negatively impacted by several social determinants of health, a big one being social support."}, {"speaker": "Lauren Wadham", "time": "43:02", "text": "they really value a community approach to their birth and to their care. So because we don't have Inuit midwives, and we don't have a good structure for allowing birth within communities, a lot of women are flown outside of their community to have a delivery. Having said that, a lot of the midwives do go to Yellowknife. There's a hospital called Stanton Hospital in Yellowknife, which provides some of the most culturally appropriate and sensitive care that I've ever heard, I've been seen, and I'm very, very, very proud of what they do. But having said that, the ideal is for women to be able to choose to stay in their own communities for their pregnancy in their birth, or at least to have the option whether they want to stay or not. And I think of the biggest barriers to that is that we don't focus on training Inuit midwives, or health care providers in general, a lot of people I've worked with in the nurse or non-Inuit, at the higher levels at the physician level have been nursing level at the midwife level. And I think if we focused on that, that would really help with many of our disparities that we're seeing, because it's just traditionally language and culturally more appropriate. And on top of that, because of our history in Canada's, it's only really been a generation between the residential schools and a lot of the horrible things that our nation has done to the Inuit people. And I was even able to see that while I was there, and it's gonna take us a very long time to come out of that. And there's a lot of work to be done there. And healthcare is very much at the center in the core of that because, yeah, the disparities in the north are very huge, very huge. And I just feel so privileged that I get to be working up there, but I also feel like there's just more we could be doing, and I think we can do it. I don't think it's attainable I think it's completely attainable."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "45:02", "text": "As Lauren reminds us, we sometimes don't recognize that disparities exist in our own backyard. It's important to build capacity within a community and with the beneficiaries to make sure resource or program can provide the maximum benefit. Our last guest is Jane Francis, a PhD student and registered dietitian in the department of Nutritional Sciences here at U of T. Her research focuses on increasing access to breastfeeding support for new mothers from marginalized backgrounds, a program called pin step, the Parkdale Infant Nutritional Security Targeted Evaluation Project."}, {"speaker": "Jane Frances", "time": "45:35", "text": "I'm currently doing my PhD in Nutritional Sciences here at U of T. And so the research program that I'm part of is called PINSTEP. And this is actually an academic and community partnership that we have with Parkdale Queen West Community Health Center in Toronto, in the Parkdale and Queen West neighborhood. And what this partnership is interested in exploring is whether we can integrate postnatal lactation support into a program we have in Canada called the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program, or CPNP. And we're interested in this to increase access to postnatal lactation support for vulnerable women and hopefully help increase breastfeeding practices among vulnerable women."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "46:26", "text": "Nice. And so so the focus of this episode is on the experiences and decisions that expectant or new moms might make. One of which is whether or not to breastfeed. So what are like sort of the Canadian guidelines around this? What would you want to tell expectant moms? What do you think they should know? So the actually, the global public health recommendations for infant feeding come from the World Health Organization or the WHO, and these infant feeding guidelines have been adopted by Health Canada, and it is recommended for women to breastfeed exclusively for the first six months of life. And so what that means is that for the first six months, babies only need to receive breastmilk. So no other foods or liquids, not even water are needed. And in Canada, we do recommend infants to get 400 International unit vitamin D supplement for babies who are breastfed. Just because in Canada, we are in a northern latitude, and it's actually recommended to protect your skin from the sun so that vitamin D supplement is needed. Jane emphasized the benefits of breastmilk for both the infant and mom. for infants. Breastmilk is the optimal source of nutrition, but also contains bioactive components, like antibodies, and human milk oligosaccharides, which help protect against infection and help with gastrointestinal development. For moms, breastfeeding has been shown to reduce their risk of breast and ovarian cancer, as well as diabetes. So there are a lot of reasons supporting breastfeeding. But what about moms who can't breastfeed because of lack of resources, knowledge, support or financial barriers?"}, {"speaker": "Jane Frances", "time": "48:05", "text": "As I mentioned, I think we do a good job of delivering the message that women should breastfeed and that there are benefits to it. But I think oftentimes, the conversation kind of ends there. And there's no further discussion on how lactation works, or how the first few days postpartum, like what those will actually look like. In reality, you don't just deliver a baby and your milk starts flowing, right? There's challenges that will happen. And and we need to talk about those challenges before women deliver so they know what to expect. And then they also know where to access support. So I mean, what's really interesting is that in Canada, most women start breastfeeding. So we have really high breastfeeding initiation rates around 91%. So a lot of women start breastfeeding, and many women want to breastfeed, but half of women stop breastfeeding before six months, and only 30% in Canada are exclusively breastfeeding for six months. So we do a really good job of promoting breastfeeding so that women start, but I think we kind of have to focus a bit more on the actual postnatal period when women are actually doing the breastfeeding and them and their baby are learning it. So it's interesting you asked about, you know, women's to sit like it's an individual, whether it's a women's individual choice to breastfeed and whatnot. So one of my favorite quotes from the Lancet breastfeeding series from 2016 is breastfeeding is generally thought to be an individual's decision and the sole responsibility of a woman to succeed ignoring the role of society in its support and protection. So it's not just about the mom, it's about the whole family, and it's about society, and the way we look at infant feeding and the way that we support new moms."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "50:05", "text": "Jane's PhD work focused on doing just that, supporting Toronto based moms from marginalized populations to breastfeed. She recently published a qualitative study in the Journal of Maternal and Child Nutrition assessing a new postnatal lactation support program run through the Parkdale Queen West Community Health Center, and their on site CPNP or Canadian Prenatal Nutrition Program. We asked her to walk us through some of her key findings."}, {"speaker": "Jane Frances", "time": "50:31", "text": "The CPNP is a federally funded program. So through the Public Health Agency of Canada, they provide funds for for community agencies to develop or expand maternal infant health interventions, and programming specifically for vulnerable women, or women who are living in challenging life circumstances. So as we talked about, this might mean women who are low income have low education, social isolation, single parents, etc. And so the actual goal of the CPNP is to improve healthy birth weight, so improve birth outcomes, but also to promote and support breastfeeding. And so there's a really great prenatal breastfeeding education component built into the CPNP. And so we want to build on this breastfeeding promotion and strong breastfeeding education component that they have to integrate postnatal lactation support, so that there's support available to women once they deliver their baby and when they might encounter challenges. And so with this paper with our community partners at Parkdale, Queen West Community Health Center, they had existing funding additional charitable funding to create a lactation support program for their CPNP participants. So we saw this as an opportunity to evaluate this existing model to see what's working well and what women think of of their experience with this program to better inform kind of our next steps of how we could bring this model of postnatal lactation support to other CPNP sites. And so with this study, it was a it was a qualitative study. So we spoke with almost 50 moms who attended this CPNP site and had access to the postnatal lactation support. And this postnatal lactation support includes in home visits with a lactation consultant. So a lactation consultant is an expert in lactation and lactation management. So they're the experts. And typically lactation consultant services or private lactation consultant services are available but it's it's not covered by OHIP. So it can be pretty expensive support to to access, sometimes up to $150 an hour, so it's not typically a service that vulnerable moms would even know about or be able to afford. And so this postnatal lactation support provides in-home lactation consultant services and double electric breast pumps to moms if they need it. And we wanted to hear about their experiences with breastfeeding and their experiences with the program, the lactation support program. And what we found and what they told us was that most women experienced a lot of breastfeeding challenges that they weren't expecting. And so through discussions with these women interviews and focus groups, we found that there were actually three distinct types of challenges. So physical challenges which might have included things such as low milk supply or difficulty with breastfeeding technique, like latching and positioning. Practical challenges included just kind of things that made it difficult to breastfeed with a new baby like not having enough money to access, lactation support, or just time constraints and time commitments, caring for other children and recovering from childbirth. And then emotional challenges are challenges with breastfeeding self efficacy, which is mother's confidence in her ability to breastfeed. So most women said they knew that they wanted to breastfeed and they started breastfeeding, but they just weren't prepared for these challenges. And what they also told us was that the lactation support was really highly valued by these women and helped to address kind of each of those elements of of breastfeeding difficulties. And there were there were kind of these three components that were especially essential according to the women that we spoke to, and that was the skilled support so the skilled provider who was the lactation consultant who provided care in the home and in a non-judgmental and caring manner. So, those were kind of the key findings."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "55:10", "text": "Jane emphasized that the biggest impact of the program came from the ability of the moms to have lactation consultants come directly to their home, free of charge on a flexible schedule that worked for them, removing the necessity for them to travel, especially in the first few days after birth when they're still recovering from birth, or possibly even caring for other children. She mentioned that some of the moms who participated in the study were newcomers to Canada. And while many would have had support from family and friends had they been in their home countries, they often lacked that same support here in Canada, making navigating the postpartum period extra difficult. She says that we need to be mindful to create programs that are accessible to and can work for all mothers. Finally, like Lauren, who emphasized how MSF strives to integrate into existing frameworks to gain community acceptance. Jane also explains how the effectiveness of the postnatal lactation support program was increased by integrating it into existing CPNP sites that had gained community acceptance already,"}, {"speaker": "Jane Frances", "time": "56:12", "text": "like another reason that we want to, you know, try and integrate postnatal lactation support into CPNP sites is because, you know, there's already this network of an established program that has a really strong social support component. And from our experiences, they're just talking to women, they they have a relationship with the, with the providers, they are providing these CPNP services, right. So they have a comfort level already with this program. And then by offering postnatal lactation services, it's not just someone random calling you to see how breastfeeding is going. It's coming from, you know, a trusted person, that you've built a relationship with prenatally, not necessarily the lactation consultants themselves, but just the providers at the CPNP the team members who are dealing with these women prenatally. So, yeah, I think I think trust and building that relationship is is a really key component, which is why we want to try and integrate these postnatal lactation services into an existing program where that social support and trust already exists."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "57:30", "text": "Jane says that the next step is to quantitatively show that the program increases breastfeeding in the first six months postpartum. And then to scale up the program across other CPNP sites in Toronto, and eventually across Canada, with the goal of being able to provide the evidence to encourage increased funding allocation to support such programs."}, {"speaker": "Jane Frances", "time": "57:49", "text": "Since CPNP is a national program, we need data on whether it's effective at improving breastfeeding rates in different areas in different places across the country. So we're currently exploring opportunities to do this on the east coast of Canada. So in the Atlantic provinces, and basically, we will do similar work at building relationships with community partners, which is really key in all of this work. And our community partners are wonderful, because they're the ones who are actually providing these programs and services to women, right. So our relationship and having them involved in the research and understanding what they need as well, has just been so key. So we want to develop these relationships with potential community partners and CPNP sites out east to figure out how this model could be adapted to, to integrate into their sites, and hopefully, across the whole country eventually,"}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "58:49", "text": "it's programs like these that are aiming to decrease disparities in maternal and infant health care, but getting moms the support they need when they need it. We asked one of our new moms what advice she might have for expectant mothers, or those who know someone expecting a baby."}, {"speaker": "Mom 1", "time": "59:04", "text": "I think the most important thing is that you're gentle with yourself. If you're the birthing parents, or a member of a family that's waiting for a baby, especially now, especially now in the middle of a pandemic. Be Be gentle with yourself. Having a baby trying to have a baby is such a wonderful thing. But it's also hard and you will be tired, and that's okay. Be gentle with yourself and find community in a form that works for you. I guess if there's anyone listening that isn't about to have a baby but that knows somebody who is that a great kindness would be to offer to do something specific for them. Can I bring you a meal? Can I partner in a pandemic? But whatever it is, if it's someone in your bubble: Can I come over and sweep your floor and make you a cup of tea?

And, I recognize that, from a career perspective, there's never a perfect time. So, those were the factors that helped me decide to try for the pregnancy at that stage. That was my first one. Once I had my first child, I was on a maternity leave, and I decided it would be easier to extend my maternity leave and have another baby, as we were clear we wanted another child and we didn't want to have big gaps between them. So, that's really what decided me to go for the second pregnancy. And then, the third pregnancy, we were overseas, and again, I was on career break, and I was having an extended leave.

I also really value my role in teaching many young women about their fertility, helping some of them preserve their fertility if they wish. And so, I'm really excited to be here today to chat all about fertility and infertility. I think that, in any discussion on infertility, it's good to sort of start with the basics. So, let's chat a little bit about what is fertility, and that may lead us to what infertility is. So, fertility is the natural ability to conceive and produce children. Infertility, on the other hand, we generally define as trying to conceive for at least one year without success. And in the case of women who were 35 or older, we say six months with no success. There are some really important facts or stats that I think everyone should consider as their foundation. So, women are generally most fertile in their 20s. And then, fertility starts to decline in their 30s, more rapidly after the age of 35. And after the age of 40, fertility is more significantly compromised, leading to lower pregnancy rates and higher miscarriage rates. In Canada, about one in six couples are going to deal with infertility. And overall, about one in four pregnancies are going to end in miscarriage. When discussing infertility, I think it's really important to be aware that infertility affects both women and men. So, female factor in fertility makes up about 30% of cases, male factor infertility makes up about 30% of cases, and about 20 to 30% of cases can be attributed to a combination of male and female infertility. And, that leaves about 10 to 20% of infertility that's considered unexplained."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "8:34", "text": "As Dr. Abrol just explained, fertility is complex, and there's a lot to think about sometimes at vulnerable or busy times in our lives. We have Dr. Abrol when we might want to start thinking about our own fertility and when seeking expertise from a fertility specialist is a good idea."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kaajal Abrol", "time": "8:50", "text": "So I think that this really depends on whether this individual is trying to conceive or not trying to conceive. So, I'll sort of talk about each of those separately. So, if a woman is trying to conceive, I would say that after one year of trying to conceive without success or even six months if she's over the age of 35, she should get a referral to a fertility specialist. However, if she has issues with ovulation, so irregular cycles, and she's trying to conceive, I've actually say she shouldn't wait those six months or a year. She should actually get medical advice right away because this is something that we could help treat right away and actually allow her to try by helping her ovulate. The other reasons in a woman trying to conceive that I would think to see a fertility specialist a little bit sooner is if she notices a sudden change in her menstrual cycles that persists. It's not something that she just sees for like a month or two, and that stuff like total absence of periods, or having surgery on her uterus and then all of a sudden having very light periods, having extremely heavy periods, having a history of specific sexually transmitted diseases - so gonorrhea, chlamydia specifically can actually affect the fallopian tubes. So, if you've had a history of these and possibly not been treated adequately, it's worth getting an assessment. Anyone who's had a history of surgery involving their ovaries may consider an assessment a little bit sooner than that one year mark. Now, for women who aren't trying to conceive, I think that it's a really individual decision. And like I said, I think it's based on their age anyhow but also their sort of short- and long-term goals and plans. So, I would tell anybody who's in their 30s, who wants to put off thinking about their reproductive health, to really be aware that the female age has a big impact on fertility. So, I think it's really important for women to educate themselves so that they can make the right decisions now as well as in the future without any regrets. So, at the very least, someone who's in their early to mid 30s postponing pregnancy may consider a consultation with a fertility specialist because a basic workup would at least allow them to learn about their ovarian reserve, or any other factors that could affect their chances of conceiving. And, I also think based on those results, it would allow them to explore what their options are to build a family either now or in the future. They may consider trying now if they have a partner or even consider using donor sperm. They could consider freezing eggs. They may consider freezing embryos with a partner or again with donor sperm. So there's a lot of options out there. And, I think it's really important to just get the information and the education so they can make an informed decision."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "11:58", "text": "It's important that women and their partners are informed and educated about fertility early, even before they want to conceive, because there are several factors that may lead to infertility. These include medical disorders, one of which is polycystic ovarian syndrome, or PCOS, as Dr. Abrol explains."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kaajal Abrol", "time": "12:15", "text": "So, polycystic ovarian syndrome, commonly known as PCOS, is a hormonal disorder in women that leads to infrequent or irregular ovulation. And as a result, these women have irregular menstrual cycles. So, the diagnosis of PCOS actually requires two out of three of the following criteria: polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (so that means that they have many many tiny little follicles or fluid sacks in their ovaries, and it often looks a little bit like a pearl necklace on ultrasound), they have what we call oligo-ovulation (which is infrequent or irregular ovulation), and they have clinical or bloodwork evidence of high androgens (so clinically, this may be acne or increased hair growth throughout the body, and in terms of bloodwork, they may have high testosterone, or DHEAS, or other androgens in the blood, and this disorder affects about five to 10% of reproductive age women. The reason it's such a big deal for fertility is because it leads to infrequent ovulation. So, this hormonal disorder causes women not to ovulate regularly. And if think about it, if a woman isn't ovulating and releasing an egg regularly, there's no egg to meet the sperm and help her get pregnant.)"}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "13:34", "text": "Other disorders that can affect female fertility are often grouped into three categories: ovarian causes, fallopian tubal causes, or uterine causes. For the ovarian causes category, delayed fertility or infertility may occur if there is ovarian dysfunction or a diminished ovarian reserve of eggs."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "13:54", "text": "This can be related to advanced age, family history of early menopause, drugs such as chemotherapy, or genetic conditions, two of which are fragile X syndrome or Turner Syndrome. Fragile X syndrome can occur in males and females and occurs when there are changes in the FMR-1 gene that prevent a protein involved in creating connections between cells from being produced and often manifests with developmental or social delay."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "14:18", "text": "Turner Syndrome only affects females and results when one of the X chromosomes is missing or partially missing. It can manifest in a variety of ways including short stature, cardiac defects, and importantly, failure of ovarian development. For the tubal causes category, infertility could be due to infections such as pelvic inflammatory disease, or sexually transmitted infections, as well as endometriosis."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "14:45", "text": "Endometriosis is relatively common, affecting approximately seven to 8% of women in Canada. It is a painful disorder in which a tissue similar to the tissue that lines your uterus, the endometrium, actually grows outside of the uterus on the ovaries, bowel, and tissues lining a pelvis. Finally, uterine or other causes of female infertility can include structural abnormalities in the uterus, fibroids, polyps, or adhesions."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "15:10", "text": "It is important to remember that there are disorders that commonly affect male fertility as well. They can be categorized as pre-testicular, testicular, or post-testicular. For the pre-testicular category, male infertility may be due to an endocrine disorder such as diabetes or hypothyroidism, the misuse of androgens otherwise known as steroids, or erectile dysfunction, for a variety of reasons."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "15:38", "text": "For the testicular category, it may be due to infectious causes, such as epididymitis, which is an infection of a tube in the back of the testicles that carry sperm, or sexually transmitted diseases. It can also be related to genetic causes such as Klinefelter syndrome, which results from males being born with an extra X chromosome."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "15:56", "text": "While the presentation can vary, it is often diagnosed in adulthood. Most men with a syndrome have adversely affected testicular growth, causing reduced levels of testosterone. Finally, for the post-testicular category, the male may have a congenital or acquired blockage in the vast deferens due to infectious genetic or traumatic causes."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "16:17", "text": "Importantly, it's not only medical disorders that can affect fertility. Lifestyle factors also play a part."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kaajal Abrol", "time": "16:23", "text": "There are certain lifestyle factors that have been suggested and shown to impact egg quality. So, smoking is a good example. There are studies showing that female smokers may go through menopause five to six years earlier than non-smokers. So, that has some suggestion that lifestyle choices such as smoking may impact a quality, and there's probably many more of these that we don't necessarily know about such as excessive alcohol and what impact that may have on egg quality long-term. But, smoking is the best example that we sort of have some evidence on."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "17:04", "text": "Dr. Abrol also spoke about studies showing a genetic component to when a woman goes through menopause. If their mother or grandmother went through it early or late, they may also go through it early or late. But, this is just one component, and not all women follow these patterns. Some lifestyle factors may delay getting pregnant but not cause direct infertility such as being on birth control methods for long periods of time and waiting some time for fertility to return."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "17:31", "text": "With so many complex factors leading to infertility, if someone has concerns about infertility, they can speak to their primary care provider. And then, we'll usually get a referral to a clinic such as Dr. Abrol's. We asked Dr. Abrol what it's like for somebody coming in for a consultation at her clinic for the first time."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kaajal Abrol", "time": "17:46", "text": "I think, when you go to see a fertility specialist, your starting point is a consultation. So that's a visit with the doctor. And, that's when I take a detailed medical history from the patient as well as from the partner if there is one. I want to look for factors in their medical and their surgical history or their lifestyle that may impact their fertility. So, these are things like their pregnancy history if they have one, their menstrual history -important things like are their cycles regular, do they have pain with your periods. I want to know about a history of any sexually transmitted infections. A surgical history is a big one. Have they ever had surgery in the abdomen or pelvis or directly in the uterus? I also asked a lot about their other medical issues and medications. Some may affect fertility, but it's also a good time to sort of prepare for pregnancy, plan for pregnancy, and talk about the impact of those medical issues or medications on pregnancy. At that visit, we will generally plan their investigations or what I call their workup. So for a woman, a basic fertility investigation is gonna include testing her uterus, her fallopian tubes, as well as her ovaries. For an assessment of a woman's uterus and fallopian tubes, we can either do this through an ultrasound test or an X ray test. So, the ultrasound test is a specialized ultrasound called Asana histogram, and it's where we inject a small amount of saline solution into the uterus so that we can look inside the cavity and make sure that it looks good. We want to make sure that there's nothing in there that could potentially decrease your chance of implanting a pregnancy or increase your risk of miscarriage. At the same time, we follow this fluid through the path of the fallopian tubes and assess whether their fallopian tubes look open or not. The X ray test is fairly similar; we're assessing the cavity in the fallopian tubes. But now, we're using an X ray, and instead of saline solution, we're using a little bit of a contrast dye that gets injected. When we're testing a woman's ovaries. It involves testing her egg quantity, which is also known as her ovarian reserve. So we know that a woman's egg quality and her egg quantity are both going to decline as she ages. Unfortunately, at the present time, we don't have a specific test to predict her egg quality. So, egg quality is largely correlated with a woman's age. And, as I mentioned before, that really starts to become a factor after the mid 30s. There's also no single test that's going to tell us exactly how many eggs she has and how long she has to get pregnant before her fertility is significantly affected. But we do have a few tests that help us reflect egg quantity and thus give us a sense of how her ovaries are going to respond to fertility treatment. We call these ovarian reserve tests, and they include a day 3 FSH level (so, that's a hormone that we measure in the blood), a day 3 antral follicle count (so, that's an ultrasound assessment of her ovaries; what are we count the number of follicles or fluid sacs within the ovaries that holds the eggs), and then the last test is an anti-mullerian hormone level (so, this is another hormone that we measure and apply). And, we use these three results together to get a sense of what a woman's ovarian reserve is. Is it average? Is it above average? Or, is it below average? And from there, we can predict how she can respond to fertility medication and what is her prognosis from fertility treatment. When we're assessing a male patient, their testing would involve a semen analysis. So that's essentially a sperm test, where we look at the concentration of the sperm, the motility or movement of the sperm, and the morphology, which is looking at the size and shape of the sperm. Based on all of these results, a workup for the female partner, a workup for the male partner, if there happens to be one, we would then be able to discuss all the different treatment options that makes sense for either the individual or the couple and their prognosis from each of these and then make a treatment plan that makes sense for them."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "21:52", "text": "All of these testing procedures, new medical terminology, and difficult decisions can be exhausting for individuals and couples.

So, 10 years ago, my husband and I, we went through secondary infertility. So, we had conceived our daughter effortlessly, and we were trying for number two. And, it wasn't working as well as it did. And, we went to the fertility clinic eventually. And a few months down the road, we were told that IVF was our best option. So we proceeded, and we did IVF. And we were successful. And, I ended up conceiving twins. And our story ended happily and joyously, but it was one of the most difficult times in my life. I remember feeling like something that once worked. So well, what happens and I felt like something was wrong with me, like I was defective. And I slowly began to isolate myself from my friends, just feeling all these different types of emotions. And, I was a social worker at the time; I had my Master's in social work. And, I was a counselor, and I just, I knew that if I get through this, this is going to be my area that I'm going to help others also get through it. So, when the twins turned two, I started running this very grassroots support group out of my parents condominium amenity room, and I called it the Mind Body Fertility group. And, it was very wonderful. I had another colleague who joined me, and we had seven women. And, I could just see how beneficial it was to bring these women together to talk about a common experience and struggle and share all the different emotions. And, I also thought I wanted to provide tools to help them cope better. So, that's where the mind body came into. And, we covered a number of different coping techniques from mindfulness to cognitive restructuring to fertility yoga. And so, from my parents condominium amenity room, I connected with one of the social workers at one of the local hospitals, and I met with her, and we started running the group together, and I continue to run the group to this day. It's eight years later, and I also run a program online, which is geared to the same content but it can meet women all over the world."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "25:00", "text": "Amira's lived experience is invaluable to the work she offers and encourages today.

I just was in a bubble of \"I want to get pregnant, and I couldn't do anything\" when I was going through it. I remember like from my past past, I had done some mindfulness. And so, I sort of brought that back into my journey. And I found it to be really helpful, and I thought, \"wow, this is so healing and so like changing of the mindset through the struggle,\" and that's one of the big tools that I like to use in my practice and in my group."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "26:03", "text": "Similar to Dr. Abrol, we asked Amira to describe, step by step, what it might be like coming to her for therapy for the first time."}, {"speaker": "Amira Posner", "time": "26:10", "text": "Yeah, so everyone's different. And, you know, I often find with this population, someone will come and make an appointment and come in, and their anxiety is so heightened that I really need to have them kind of settle down and come to a place of calm before we can actually talk and I can help them try to see things differently, so using some of the techniques to help them calm their system and then teaching it to them so they can do it for themselves. And then, once they're in a more balanced state, we can start talking about some of the emotions that are coming up and a lot of normalization. You know, because it's such a private topic, people don't talk about it. So, there's a lot of shame associated with it, so helping the women understand that they're not alone and that it's a very common phenomena that we experience during a certain age group and helping them broaden their perspective, so they can have more flexible thinking and a better relationship with themselves, and the people around them, and their struggle. So, my support group, it runs for six weeks. It's very structured. And each week, we focus on a different technique. When I see someone one on one, it could vary. So, sometimes I'll do that content one on one with them. Or, sometimes it's a couple that needs support just in their communication. Or, sometimes it's an individual or a couple who are using donor conception. In those cases, I would meet with them and talk to them about the implications involved in using donor sperm, or egg donor, or surrogacy.

Dr. Abrol explained to us that there was not one that was the most common but that it really depends on the individual or the couple."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kaajal Abrol", "time": "29:20", "text": "So, when I think about fertility treatment for someone who wants to conceive, I like to break it down into sort of three main paths. So the first treatment, which actually isn't really considered assisted reproductive technology, or ART as we call it. It involves a woman taking some medication at the start of her menstrual cycle to try and develop more than one mature egg in a cycle. So as we naturally mature one egg per cycle and ovulate, we now want to make a few extra to increase the chance of an egg and sperm meeting. We can then combine this with intercourse that's timed right around ovulation to help achieve a pregnancy, and we call this controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. In a woman who actually doesn't ovulate regularly, we can still use the same medication and the same process. But now, what we want to do is help her develop even just a single, mature egg. We call this ovulation induction, and it also is combined with timed intercourse to help her get pregnant. The second path, which is actually an assisted reproductive technique, is called intrauterine insemination or IUI. So, once a woman is ovulating either one egg (if she's just having a natural cycle) or more than one egg (if she did controlled ovarian hyperstimulation), we then wash the sperm, process it, and place it inside of her uterus. So, we're bypassing the cervix and the cervical mucus, and we're putting the sperm one step closer to the egg or eggs in order to help her achieve pregnancy. And then, the last, the third treatment option is in vitro fertilization, or IVF, also a type of ART. So, this involves the process of stimulating woman's ovaries with fertility medications (usually, but not always, injectables, so little needles), where we're trying to grow and mature a number of eggs over a 10 to 14 day period of time. We then actually remove these eggs from the body through an egg retrieval procedure, which is actually an ultrasound procedure where we're draining fluid from the ovaries, looking for the little microscopic eggs in the lab, and then taking those eggs, fertilizing them with sperm in the lab in order to make embryos. And then, we're growing these embryos in our lab for five to six days and then transferring them into the uterus where hopefully they're going to implant and give a pregnancy."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "31:47", "text": "Amira talked to us about her journey with reproductive assistance."}, {"speaker": "Amira Posner", "time": "31:51", "text": "So, it was kind of an organic process, because when we started at the fertility clinic, they were quite hopeful because we had conceived our daughter naturally. Oftentimes, when a couple starts at a clinic, they start doing all the fertility tests, and sometimes that takes a bit of time. So during that time, we started other less intrusive treatment. They're called intrauterine inseminations, otherwise referred to as IUI. We tried that three times, but we were also dealing with male factor, so that was a problem. And, none of them were successful. So then, we were told that this was our next best option. I just was like, \"okay, let's do it.\""}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "32:31", "text": "Amira told us how important it was to have her husband included in the process. This is a large reason why her practice today offers to work with couples together to show how they can communicate better and to help one another feel safe and supported. She mentions that sometimes this journey can really help at strengthening a relationship, although other times, she's seen it go the other way."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "32:56", "text": "Amongst infertility options, there are also choices regarding genetic screening and freezing eggs before they are transferred back inside a woman."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kaajal Abrol", "time": "33:04", "text": "Two big topics that we can touch on. So the first one, given that we're already talking about IVF, is individuals who want to screen for genetic conditions. So traditionally, if a woman were to get pregnant, naturally, she could do prenatal screening once pregnant. So this involves bloodwork and ultrasound in the first trimester, and possibly blood work again in the second trimester, to screen for some common chromosomal abnormalities, something like Down syndrome. But, when we are doing IVF, we can actually do genetic screening on the embryos before even transferring them and achieving a pregnancy, and we call this pre-implantation genetic testing, or PGT. And, there's actually two arms to this. So, PGT-A is where we're actually testing the embryos to see if they have the correct number of chromosomes, so 46 xx or 46 xy, and we would then only transfer the embryos with a normal chromosomal makeup into the uterus. The other kind is something called PGT-M, and that's where we are actually testing the embryos for a specific genetic condition that is caused by a single gene; we then only transfer the unaffected embryos into the uterus. So, just elaborating on the process of IVF, what we would do in these scenarios is we would grow the embryos. So, sperm fertilized egg, we grew the embryos all the way to day five or six, and now we would biopsy a few cells from each embryo, freeze the embryos, and then test those cells to see what the genetic makeup is. So, in the case of PGT-A, we're seeing does it have a normal chromosomal makeup. Or, in the case of PGT-M, does it have this single gene disorder that we're trying to screen for. And then, we would put back the unaffected embryos in a subsequent cycle. So in a later cycle, we would take those frozen embryos, thaw them, and then put back in the embryos."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "35:11", "text": "Next, we spoke to Dr. Abrol all about why patients might want to freeze their eggs."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kaajal Abrol", "time": "35:16", "text": "Okay, so I think there are two big reasons why patients would want to freeze their eggs. So, the first is egg freezing for social reasons. So these are patients who want to have a family, but maybe they haven't found the right partner to do this with, and they want to preserve their fertility, keep their options open for starting a family sometime in the future. And, the second option is egg freezing for medical reasons. So, these are patients that are actually at risk of losing their fertility due to medical issues, something like undergoing chemotherapy or having surgery on their ovaries, and they want to freeze their eggs or sometimes embryos before their fertility is negatively impacted by their medical concern. For those that are thinking about egg freezing particularly for social reasons, you ideally want to think about freezing your eggs when you're younger because, as I mentioned before, egg quality and egg quantity are going to decrease with age."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "36:11", "text": "We heard that reasons for egg freezing really vary on the individual or the couple, factoring in their age and what their short- and long-term goals are. When would be a good time for women to start thinking about freezing eggs."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kaajal Abrol", "time": "36:24", "text": "So, I actually think it makes sense for women in their early 30s to think about egg freezing, possibly even their late 20s depending on their social situation. I don't think that every woman in her 20s necessarily needs to think about freezing her eggs; it may be a bit premature. But, I think that in her early 30s, perhaps late 20s, you're probably balancing the benefits of better egg quality with the cost of the procedure and any possible risk that comes with doing any medical procedure. So, somebody who is, you know, late 20s or just about 30 starting medical school knows she's going to be in school a long time. Maybe, she's currently single. Yeah, it's definitely something that she may want to consider. And, obviously the younger you do it, ideally, the better quality eggs we're freezing, so it's to her benefit."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "37:16", "text": "You can freeze either eggs or embryos. What is the difference though, and which one is a better option?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kaajal Abrol", "time": "37:22", "text": "So, I know many people will have different opinions on this. But, I think, if you have a partner with whom you know you want to build a family with, it's just not right now, I would often consider freezing embryos over eggs. The reason I say that is because we have been doing IVF and embryo freezing for a very long time, and we're very good at it. And, embryos freeze and thaw very well. Eggs are a little bit different than embryos; they're filled with a lot of water. And as a result, they don't freeze and thaw as well. Now that being said, technology has changed quite a bit. In the last 10 years or so, we used to use a process called slow freezing, and that resulted in a loss of a lot of eggs when we would thaw. We now use a process called vitrification. Essentially, it's flash freezing, and the eggs actually survive the freeze and thaw quite well. But, that being said, I still think that freezing embryo's a little bit better; the success rates higher. You also sort of know what you have. At the end of the day, when you freeze eggs, you don't actually know what you're going to have at the end of the process, because when you come to use them, we have to follow the eggs fertilized with sperm and then grow them. So, you may start with 10 eggs, but we may only have two or three embryos at the end of the day. Whereas, if you did the process of IVF and embryo freezing, you would know how many you have frozen at the end of the day. Do you have two or three embryos, or do you have four or five? So, I guess my short answer is I would push for embryo freezing in a patient who is sure of her partner and whom she wants to freeze those embryos with. But, I still think that egg freezing is quite good. So, if that is your option, I feel quite good about it."}, {"speaker": "Mom 1", "time": "39:07", "text": "I had a miscarriage after my second child, it was very difficult at the time because I really wanted the baby.

It was difficult, but then, you know, when I look back on it now, I wouldn't actually have the third child that I actually have because the child that I lost would have been born with time that couldn't have conceived the third child that I was successful with.

So, I took to taking a little bottle of milk of magnesium around with me in my handbag everywhere I went and swinging after every meal to try and stop the indigestion from happening.

And, I had heightened smell but not in a good way. Because everything made me very nauseous and ill, I had a difficult time eating certain things. So, I was limited in my food intake; pretty much I lived on crackers and very bland food. I mean, with my first pregnancy, things went really well. I was very physically fit. Other than the nausea and whatnot, it was pretty much a normal pregnancy. Unfortunately, with my second pregnancy, that was not the case, I had a cyst, the size of a grapefruit, growing along with the baby, which made it very, very challenging. I wasn't bedridden because I had a two year old. But, at the same time, I was very limited in the things that I could do. I could not pick up my firstborn because that might induce labor. So, we did a lot of activities that required things like walks to the park, and lots of puzzles, and lots of reading, and lots of things that we can do together that did not require too much physical activity. That's I had people coming in to take my son to the park and do all those physical things that I couldn't do with him.

And, a lot of times, when we're going through this journey, we are living in a lot of anticipation, and we're not present. So, mindfulness is a tool that we can use to bring us back to ourselves. Instead of thinking about our problems and trying to problem solve and figure things out, we can let that go and just be in the moment wherever we are. And, it has many different effects on your emotional state to your physiological state. And, it's a practice. It's not something that can just, \"I'm going to be mindful,\" and then you're mindful. Like a muscle. And, so just harnessing your attention in the present and working with your thoughts in a different way can be really empowering.

"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kaajal Abrol", "time": "45:34", "text": "That age does not matter, and IVF can fix all fertility issues. I want to correct that age does matter a lot for women. So, even if you look and feel young and feel your best, unfortunately, that doesn't apply to fertility and your ovaries, because as I've said over and over again in our chat today, both egg quality and quantity do decline as a woman ages, specifically over the age of 35. And unfortunately, there isn't a treatment to reverse this. Egg freezing may help some women proceeded reserve their fertility and give them options in the future. But, we don't have a way to reverse the ovaries aging. And, although fertility treatments such as IVF have come a really long way and a really great at treating so many different causes of infertility and improving pregnancy rates, they can't completely solve every issue every time. So, for example, I'm sure you can agree more and more in the media, we're seeing that women are having babies well into their 40s, maybe even early 50s. We see it in celebrities all the time. And, I think people are really led to believe that age didn't matter and that IVF helped them. But, the real answer actually is that using an egg donor to overcome the impact of age on egg quality was there. It's just not necessarily talked about in the same way. So, I think as a result, people really think that age isn't such a factor in that IVF will help them regardless of their age. I'm not here to say that IVF isn't great and that it can't help these issues. It just can't overcome everything."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "47:16", "text": "Amira adds that there is need for education and awareness."}, {"speaker": "Amira Posner", "time": "47:20", "text": "Yeah, so infertility doesn't discriminate and can hit you as early as in your 20s. Women as young as 25 may be diagnosed with premature ovarian failure and need to pursue treatment.

And, I think it will give physicians and patients really valuable information. The same goes for testing the uterus for issues with implantation. We do have some tests, but they're still fairly new. And, there is no one test that is a standard of care, but as research continues, I think it's going to lead to better and better technology and testing.

And then, when you go from the first baby to the second baby, it's like you expand your circle of love. You think that \"how could you possibly love another baby as much as you love your first baby,\" and somehow your heart just opens and circle gets bigger and bigger and bigger.

If a woman's keen to have a home birth and it's supported in the country infrastructure that she has, then I'd say go for it, but equally, don't feel under pressure and recognize that even the best laid plans of mice and men, as they say, that may be your plan, and you may have to change it if there are complications."}, {"speaker": "Mom 4", "time": "53:53", "text": "The most important thing to me during my pregnancy was information, and I think the prenatal classes I attended were so informative.

While many of us take for granted the ability to express our true selves, it was only in June of 2017 that gender identity and expression was officially recognized and protected from discrimination under the Canadian Human Rights Act. This and many other policy changes, including those related to healthcare, stem from decades of effort and courage from the trans community. On this episode, you'll hear several perspectives on the past, present, and future of trans health. We spoke to Susan Gapka, a trans-rights advocate and Education and Training Program facilitator at The 519, who discussed her work at The 519, political activism, and lived experience as a trans individual. We also spoke with Sly Sarkisova, a psychotherapist and a registered clinical social worker specializing in trauma and LGBTQ+-related mental health, who walked us through the challenges faced by trans and non-binary folks and how they might interact with the healthcare system. Finally, Dr. Mitchell Brown, an Associate Professor in Department of Surgery at University of Toronto and plastic surgeon at Women's College Hospital, spoke to us about the Transition-Related Surgery Program, the first public hospital-based surgical program in Canada focused on providing safe and timely access to transition-related surgical care.", "authors": ["Tsukiko Miyata"], "prod_team": [], "tags": [], "links": [{"title": "Rainbow Health Ontario", "href": "https://www.rainbowhealthontario.ca/"}, {"title": "Sherbourne Health", "href": "https://sherbourne.on.ca/"}, {"title": "Women's College Hospital - Transition Related Surgeries Program", "href": "https://www.womenscollegehospital.ca/care-programs/surgery/transition-related-surgeries/"}, {"title": "The 519", "href": "https://www.the519.org/"}, {"title": "Toronto Trans Coalition Project", "href": "http://transcoalitionproject.com/"}, {"title": "CAMH Gender Identity Clinic", "href": "https://www.camh.ca/en/your-care/programs-and-services/gender-identity-clinic-adult"}, {"title": "Glad Day Bookshop", "href": "https://www.gladdaybookshop.com/"}, {"title": "Flamingo Rampant - A micropress with a mission", "href": "https://www.flamingorampant.com/"}, {"title": "Sly Sarkisova", "href": "https://www.slysarkisovacounselling.com/"}], "transcripts": [{"speaker": "Susan Gapka", "time": "0:03", "text": "I think that same evolution is going to happen over the next 10 to 20 years with trans right.

They've helped our society define and understand concepts like transgender, non-binary and gender non-conforming. You'll hear from them both throughout the episode as they share their wealth of knowledge, lived experience, and historical perspectives on transgender health in Canada. I sat down with Sly Sarkisova , a social worker and psychotherapist based in Toronto who specializes in trauma, mental health, addiction, and psychotherapy for people who identify along the LGBTQ+ spectrum. You'll hear more about his practice and personal journey a little later in the episode. But first, we asked him to help orient us and you, our listeners, with a short lesson in gender studies 101."}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "3:59", "text": "So, gender identity is basically just your sense of your gender. So it's an internal idea of who you are. Some, some people don't really think of themselves in a gendered way, and others think of themselves in a very gendered way. So it's your internal self concept in relation to the things that we externally reference as masculine, feminine, neither nor, androgynous traits, behavior, likes, preferences. But mostly, it's your internal sense of yourself in relation to gender. Gender expression is how you're comfortable to express your gender in the world. So it's the signals that you get, give to others about who you are in a gendered sense, to include your way of presenting yourself in the world to your dress preferences, the kinds of activities that you're interested, in the way that you hold yourself, the way that you are affectively, emotionally, socially, those sorts of things."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "4:55", "text": "And so what does it mean to identify as trans or non-binary?"}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "4:58", "text": "Basically, being trans person means that you don't identify with the social construct of gender that was placed upon you at birth. So traditionally, historically, we've looked to biology, physiology, the body, whatnot, and looked at people's reproductive organs to determine what their internal sense of their self is, their gender identity. And trans people have really created a space for folks to push back against that limited understanding of gender and identity. And to look at the ways in which your identity does not necessarily have to be about your reproductive organs. You know, it's sort of a space where you develop your own sense of your internal self, it might be oppositional to what you were assigned at birth, or it might be something more diverse than that, it might be a non binary identity or something else. So non-conforming simply just means that you don't adhere to the gender expectations of your biological sex. So we say in the trans community \"assigned sex at birth\", because typically, folks are designated into female or male on site at birth-based on what people think of their genitals. So, in gender non-conforming can be socially; it can be in in various ways."}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "6:10", "text": "You know, I helped coined the word trans persons in 2003, with Rupert Raj with Ontario Public Health Association when we were using \"trans person\" or \"trans man\" and \"trans woman\" is one word actually back then with capital letters, too, and for many people, younger people find those terms offensive, but in our times, we, those were the terms that we knew and understood."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "6:39", "text": "You might recognize that voice from the beginning of the episode. That was Susan Gapka. Susan is a Toronto based trans activist who helped define trans as our society understands it today.

As a member of the 519, I also am on the member of CUPE, which means that I'm on the Ontario executive board and for the Pink Triangle Committee's Chair, so that's more political. My work at 519 is more around we do things like facilitating meetings, consultations. My specialty is trans and non-binary people, but of course, I'm versatile. As trans people, we got to be good at everything to survive in this world. But I'm thrilled to be with you today and thrilled that you asked me to participate in this conversation."}, {"speaker": "Tsukiko Miyata", "time": "7:58", "text": "And what is your typical day working at the 519 as a facilitator of the education and training services?"}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "8:06", "text": "There are no typical days for me, cuz I'm usually project-based. But when I'm doing facilitating and training, I can tell you a little bit about. We do workshops, and I do kind of the lunch and learn workshops, where an organization will call us on; I went to Seneca College in January, and they were getting ready for the new year, and the staff wanted to know more about how to be more trans inclusive for their students and curriculum. Now, this is something we didn't have when I was growing up, a lot of education on this. I get really excited about reaching out and working with media and universities and colleges, because it's an educational piece. I think trans identities and putting a human face on and trying to have an interaction around who we are and what our needs are, I think is it's a human connection kind of thing. And you know, not everybody's gonna agree with us, but I think so many more people are being more compassionate, and more understanding, and eager to learn more about how to be respectful and to treat people with respect and dignity. So, I'm excited to be part of that process. But sometimes, we'll do like consultations on on issues like when the provincial government, when they were changing the identification requirements, or when the Ministry of Health was changing, access to transition related surgeries and what the criteria are. So, one thing that we do really well, I think, is whole those community consultations in our space, and what the 519 also does something remarkably well is we hold space for trans community members for like trans day of remembrance, which is every November, is made up of community members and facilitated by other staff. I do the memorial part of that day. We also start in the morning with Breakfast Television interview, and it's so it's like a 20 hour day. But, it's really mostly we hold space and facilitate conversations for trans community members and trans and non-binary people, so they can bring their energies, their talents, and their artistry to our building, and we hold space for that to happen. So I'm very proud of the work that we do."}, {"speaker": "Tsukiko Miyata", "time": "10:26", "text": "Why do you do this work?

And I saw really no future in my life. I experienced suicidality. I really didn't have hope. I ended up on the streets of Toronto for 10 years. And suddenly then, I came to terms. I figured that midlife, midlife being the operational word here, just that realizing it, what I hope to be my midlife that it's not a passing phase; there was something to this, and I had to look into it. And since then, it's been like, I've been like a seed in the desert that suddenly has gotten water and God, love, and nutrition that I didn't have growing up. And to be able to do, to be my authentic self in the workplace, in the media, and in my public life, and in socially included in Ontario and Canadian society is such, there are no words in the language to describe the feeling of finally overcoming my challenges and being recognized, and having like people who like to see me, people asking me for interviews, and to be an educator and to become an educator for a generation of people who are coming up so that it's, and really my original purpose is, the same purpose today at this very moment, is that younger people can have a better life than the hardship I struggled through as a child. And, that's reward enough to actually have an apartment in downtown Toronto, the best employer that I could possibly ever find, the most political union that I work with, and to have all of that in my life is such a pleasure, and such a treasure. I get to be a generation for younger trans children coming out and trans families. I get to be the wise elder that I didn't have growing up. And that's, you know, that's, that's just beautiful.

But, I started, I started my career in Vancouver in the downtown South at a mental health drop-in center. And then, I sort of tailored my education from there to get more specifically into psychotherapy. So, I work to the mental health drop-in center, and I did various frontline mental health roles, outreach worker, and things like that, homeless outreach, all sorts of things for six years. And then, I moved directly into the Downtown Eastside and was doing trauma-informed psychotherapy, and like co-occurring disorders therapy, so a lot of heavy in trauma-informed work around addiction management, and that was a couple of years, and then I moved out to Toronto and did my Master's in Social Work. I had a, an undergrad originally in Psychology, and then I did a second undergrad in Social Work and did some social work, came out here. I did a Master's in Social Work and then started working at a local LGBTQ centric health center for several years on their interdisciplinary health team.

In addition to that, I do workshops and trainings for organizations around mental health trauma addiction and gender identity and offer clinical supervision, as well, to a number of folks."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "15:01", "text": "And what are some of the challenges that trans people and non-binary people face today?"}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "15:06", "text": "It's an interesting time. It seems to be a quite an explosion of knowledge around trans issues, and especially non-binary issues. So, I think there's been tremendous education happening that has really taken off from decades of like, on the ground activists fighting for your life or death sort of variances of trans people fighting for care and access. So, I think we're at a very opportune time. What are the challenges? I think that, with more access, people tend to believe that the problem is solved. So, for folks that are not younger and receiving unconditional care and support, for example, if that's the case, it's more likely to be the case these days, which is fantastic. But for older folks, people, over 30 people, over 40 people, over 50, if they're coming into themselves now and accessing trans health care, their legacy of ability to in there so authentically is much different. And there's a different way to the legacy of oppression. So that tends to get erased."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "16:08", "text": "We'll come back to this idea of a legacy of oppression. It's important to understand the history that trans people have faced and continue to face. As Sly mentioned, in today's society, the experiences of trans youth compared to trans adults at various life stages can be dramatically different. And some of the differences routed in the erasure of identity that many older adults would have experienced. While we've made strides so that this isn't the case for many youth today, we need to keep on learning. We asked Sly to walk us through what the experience of trans youth might be. "}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "16:38", "text": "Focusing a bit more with younger people now, what age might a person who is thinking that they might be trans or non-binary start to, start to question their gender identity?"}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "16:49", "text": "I think that kids know who they are quick, and they, so trans kids, non-binary kids, they often know who they are, and they get told that it's unacceptable. And, there are Identity at around two or three starts to get expressed. As soon as you're able to walk, talk, choose things, you're expressing your identity. But then, there's this whole system of like repercussions and shaming for people going outside of what they are expected in terms of being a man, or being a boy, being a girl, you get social repercussions. So, for example, a lovely friend of mine that I went to high school with contacted me recently, and her boy's in elementary school, and they don't know what his gender identity is, they don't know, you know, his romantic or sexual identity is; he's young. And but, he wanted to wear like a sparkly dress to school one day, because it's dazzling, and who doesn't want to wear sparkly frigging dress. So that you know, he immediately is getting bullied by some of the more sort of \"socially conditioned to be very masculine in traditional ways\" kids. So the kids that have been taught to believe that femininity is gross, or wrong, or sick, or weak, whatever, especially, for being a boy, you know, they get the social repercussions from that. And that's where bullying happens. And that's where you start to tuck away your identity and you don't feel safe to express it."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "18:12", "text": "Does gender nonconformity always lead to gender transition? Now, how should young parents be thinking about their children's gender identity and expression?"}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "18:19", "text": "Yeah, I just want to clarify it. So gender non-conforming doesn't necessarily mean you're trans. You could be gender non-conforming and trans; that is true. But, I just want to clarify, because if someone's watching this thing, oh, my kids gender non-conforming, they're automatically trans. You don't have to get so worried around how to support your kid, but it's good to know what the differences are. And so I think basically, if kids identify as trans, not just gender non-conforming but also trans, like their, their, you know, their identity doesn't fit in terms of how others see them. They know they are they're expressing, you know, a different gender identity. And let's say they are very, very uncomfortable around what their body might be doing in terms of approaching adolescence. That's when, like, trans youths often express a lot of distress. So around puberty is when gender role is really getting or have, have traditionally gotten revved up. And the things that their body are starting to do start to cause extreme distress. And that's when they might tell a parent, \"I need to transition\", and they will look into medical options, but that process takes a few years. It's not just available necessarily on demand. Trans youth care is evolving. And, you know, usually the youth are put on blockers for a time if they feel extremely consistent and solid in their identities and very strongly that they are, you know, who they who they are. They are supported to go on blockers for a time to stop the feminization or masculinization of their body so that they can have some time to see if they feel comfortable. And usually it's the children or youths that are extremely adamant about who they are. The adults sort of hold back, so they might have to wait for a few years before they actively start taking cross-gender hormones, but they could have access younger if they're in a lot of distress and very adamant about who they are."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "20:11", "text": "Sly just mentioned that youth who feel extremely consistent in their identities can sometimes be put on blockers. He's referring to puberty blockers. As you might imagine, puberty can be an especially stressful time for those who identify as trans as they start to develop secondary sex characteristics they don't identify with. Puberty blockers are medications that delay puberty by blocking the hormones, estrogen and testosterone. Blockers aren't a permanent solution by any means, but they allow trans youths to hit the pause button, so to speak, until they're able to explore other options, which may include taking cross-gender hormones or hormone therapy."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "20:49", "text": "What is hormone therapy, and why are trans and non-binary people interested in it? "}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "20:54", "text": "So, hormone therapy is the ability to take hormones that your body produces maybe not in the ideal amounts that you would hope. So we all have estrogen and testosterone in our bodies, but for for folks who want to attain more cross-gender effects, so to speak, so to masculinize your body, you would take testosterone as hormonal therapy and to use effects that are in line with how comfortable you feel in your gender and, and or you could take estrogen therapy and you could feminize your body. So you get the secondary sex characteristics basically, of a second puberty, puberty that you felt most comfortable with when you start taking hormones, and that's through your doctor."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "21:33", "text": "Do you have any advice or thoughts for healthcare professionals when they're working with younger clients to ensure that they're delivering their care in a responsible and ethical manner?"}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "21:42", "text": "As I understand that there's no age of consent in province of Ontario. So, you basically just need to take a client-centered approach and really listen to the youth in front of you and see what they're telling you. Like, I know that sounds really simple, but it's like what is the youth telling you about who they are, has that been consistent, and how can you support them? it's unlikely that people will get hormones at a very young age because they have to hit puberty first. That's just how it works, medically speaking; I'm not a doctor, but I know that they have to reach a certain age, 10 or age 12 something like that, a puberty in development before they can even go on blockers. And then there's some time in between there and starting them on hormones, but just to listen and support the family and see what is needed. And they might need a social worker, they may need some peer support groups, they might need a therapist, but usually they know who they are, and they're just persistent about it and need to be listened to."}, {"speaker": "Atefeh Mohammadi", "time": "22:37", "text": "So far, you've heard a lot about the journey and supports available for transgender youth. But as you heard with Susan's, and as you're hearing Sly's, these kinds of supports weren't always available. It's because of advocacy from folks like Susan and Sly that society has come to better accept and understand non-conforming, non-binary and trans individuals. You heard Sly mentioned that in his practice, he provides trauma-informed psychotherapy for folks to cope with legacies of oppression. So we asked him about the experiences of older adults who may realize that gender nonconforming, trans, or non-binary much later in life."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "23:20", "text": "Do you have any advice for adults who are, you know, say like 40, 50, 60 years old, and they're thinking about transitioning now because circumstances in their lives have changed?"}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "23:30", "text": "Yeah, I think a lot of the work, again, is emotional and social, and sense of like, you have to sort of come to terms with the fact that you've had to live in your body and in your identity a certain way for a lifetime, right? And, you might have, might have gone through various different identifiers, you might have identified as a lesbian at one point, then weren't sure, then non-binary, and/or all the above, and trans. like, for example, or you might have identified as a gay man because that was the only option available and suddenly like in your 40s, realize, \"wow, like, I'm actually trans, and I've been trans this whole time, but I've been operating under the assumption that I couldn't be.\" So a lot of the work there is less about medical care access and more about, \"wow, can I really do it? Can I actually have access to this thing that I've always sort of identified with but has been sort of compartmentalised a way of existence? And how to bring it back? And how do I, how do I integrate all the ways in which I've lived this life so far so that I don't feel like I have to shun different parts of myself in my experience, and, and to have a cohesive identity,\" regardless of where you identified along the way, that's necessity."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "24:39", "text": "To explain what the situation would have been like for his own generation, Sly generously shared his experience."}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "24:45", "text": "So one of the reasons I moved to Ontario was to transition, and I had been thinking about it for a decade. And but, around 2003, I became aware that trans men existed; it was the first time I saw them represented in local media. And there were very few trans-identified people in my community, and the identification was very binary. So if you were a trans man, you were a man full stop. And there was no room for gender variants or understanding your identity as non-binary. And I am a non-binary person, I always have been. So I had to really fight in my own space for, for 10, 15 years to understand that I could exist and then spread that outward. So when I moved out to Ontario, again, I did not hear people talking about non-binary identities as being trans and had to do a lot of work personally in my community, went to community events, to question traditional gender options in our inner identified spaces like LGBT spaces. In my work, I was constantly educating doctors and my colleagues around non-binariness, writing about it, so I had to fight really hard to have access a decade before people were talking about it. Now it's very common. Everybody seems to get it. That was not the case. You could not get care if you're non-binary. And so, I had to really fight on my own with no support and also providing support for others. So it's been quite a process. And that tends to get erased, because people think, \"oh, well, you know, non-binary is a thing now.\" So, you know, but when you're a person caught in between generations where that wasn't possible and you're doing that fight, there's a lot of work there to make yourself a valid person with no reference points."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "26:25", "text": "Yeah, thank you for sharing that.

And, and you kind of think, or you're told even by community who are not trans that are when you choose a transition, you're going to have all this privilege. And for sure I'm perceived, you know, mostly as a, as a non-trans man in the world that a white man, but that's also influenced by how people read your masculinity. And so, I'm a short person, I am non-binary, and I am very emotional, and I have an aura about me that it's very gentle and empathetic. And I've experienced, you know, so much violence so from other men who don't even read me as trans but pick up something about me that doesn't match their expectations of being a man. I had multiple, I think it was six, I lost count, on the spot death threats from men just out in the world raging about for various reasons. So and, I think my experience is somewhat exceptional, I'm not sure what the deal is. But in my person, I feel fantastic, in my body, I feel fantastic, and in my identity, I feel fantastic.

And for me, it was very binary growing up. It was like, either you are a man or a woman. And now in today's society, transition has different meanings for people. So there's different thoughts on that. But like, for me, transitioning was very challenging. Because I was a political activist, I actually had to change a bunch of laws to get access to health care that I required, needed. I make a little bit of a joke, you know, if you could see me here. I didn't get this beautiful on my own; I had to like change laws to do it. But I say that tongue in cheek. It's easier to change your legal status. So I'll do a little Foucault here. Maybe, it's like so, we're regulated by society on our legal documents through legal means and medical means, so gatekeepers around access to hormones and surgery for those people. And nowadays, some people, there was, in 1969 model at the gender identity clinic at what is now known as Center for Addiction and Mental Health, it was a single track surgery option without a little bit of understanding about, around all of the social supports required. So, people socially transition, and they medically transition. And so there's a lot going on with that because I change it, you change your name, for me, that was necessary, change your legal ID, but you also have to come out to a lot of people, and it's a real challenge. And, there's appropriate disclosure. And, I have found myself already working in a lot of organizations, I hadn't realized how extensive and significant that would be. For me, 20 years ago, the first time six to eight months were damn near impossible."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "31:03", "text": "Susan acknowledges that improvements have been made for trans individuals since the beginning of her trans rights campaign and her own personal journey."}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "31:11", "text": "The access for funding is so much better.

I think it's okay that people are demanding better, because that's what we did back then. And it's going to be even better for the next generation.

The Transition-related Surgery Program is an initiative rising from this partnership that's led by Women's College Hospital, and it aims to improve access to specialized trans health services. Now, this is the first public hospital-based surgical program in Canada to provide accessible and safe surgical services for trans and non-binary people. Dr. Brown is an active member of the surgical team. And he told us more about how the program came about."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Mitchell Brown", "time": "33:15", "text": "It was really an identification that there was a need. And, and Ontario, as in many places in Canada, people had to travel great distances frequently to Quebec, to the United States, outside of continental North America in order to obtain appropriate services for transition-related surgery. And so, in cooperation with the government, Women's College Hospital and the government created this collaborative program. I believe we're now in our third year. We've had tremendous growth. We started slowly. You know, when you have a program like this, you need to create infrastructure. You need to create an environment of safety and comfort and respect that we try to provide to everybody, but in, in a new world, you need to understand and learn some of the basic things you may not have appreciated before: proper use of pronouns, changing electronic medical record system so it adequately reflects more than just a he or she, which some basic old systems don't reflect. So I think we've developed that nicely over the last several years. We've been on an exponential curve in terms of the number of individuals we've been able to treat and manage, and we look to see that grow over the next several years."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "34:30", "text": "The process of transition is multifaceted. There's no sole healthcare professional that is able to provide all the necessary services for trans patients alone.

It's much more than just about surgery. And, the team really involves everything from counselors and psychologists and, when appropriate, psychiatrists through primary care physicians and nurse practitioners and social workers, and to some degree, the surgeons are at the end of the line. You know, we're able to provide, hopefully, thoughtful and good quality care, but in conjunction with an entire team in the world that I live in as plastic surgeons, there's certain things that we're capable of doing. But we work with our other colleagues. There's dermatologic changes dealing with issues of the skin and hair patterns that can be critical in transitioning. We deal with otolaryngologist to deal with things like the Adam's apple, for example, or voice manipulation. And then I haven't talked at all about bottom surgery, which is something that we do offer at Women's College, especially for our trans female patients. And that is performed through a combination of surgeries with plastic surgeons, urologists, and gynecologists."}, {"speaker": "James Saravanamuttu", "time": "36:06", "text": "I was curious as to what types of these surgeries are there."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Mitchell Brown", "time": "36:08", "text": "The work that we focus on primarily in our gender confirming surgery program at Women's College is largely what we would call top surgery, and top surgery is essentially breast or chest surgery, and that might be masculinization of the chest, that kind of looks like the removal of the breast tissue, reducing the size of the nipple and areola from a female areola to a male looking areola, and repositioning it in an appropriate place on the chest, perhaps removing redundant or excess fat all in a way to try to make the chest look more masculine. In trans female surgery, we might be taking a breast that might have grown a little bit through hormone stimulation and then try to increase its volume through either technologies like fat grafting or through the insertion of a breast implant. And, interestingly enough, they're not necessarily binary choices. And there are some individuals who wish to essentially demonstrate themselves as a non-binary individual and may wish to just not have a expression of a breast but not necessarily look for a masculine ches, just don't wish to have a breast there, and they wish to have a flat chest. So it's, it lives within a spectrum, I would say.

And that procedure is done by two of our urologists at Women's College Hospital. And we've done several of those procedures now. It, for trans male individuals, that procedure would be called phalloplasty or trying to create a phallus, a bit of a different kind of operation. It requires some sub-specialized microsurgical technology. We don't provide that service at Women's College at the moment, of course because it's primarily an outpatient facility, a Women's College, and when microsurgery is involved, it's a larger procedure that requires a number of days of inpatient care. We may be looking for collaborative partners in Toronto and one of the downtown teaching hospitals to be able to offer phalloplasty services, but at the moment, we're not offering that."}, {"speaker": "Atefeh Mohammadi", "time": "38:44", "text": "Could you give us an insight into the age range of the patients that you see?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Mitchell Brown", "time": "38:49", "text": "It's a wide spectrum. So we certainly see teenagers that brings its own level of conversation around informed consent and age of consent and reversibility. And, I have seen individuals up into their 60s, which is remarkable. And, I think we have to think back and say, you know, if you're 65 today, when you were 30, what sort of understanding, appreciation, or access was there for people who had questions about their gender identity? I mean, it was a different world then. And I'm glad that we live in a world today that is starting to open up and be more open minded to allow people to express themselves in a way that they're more comfortable and provide access for them to manage that."}, {"speaker": "Atefeh Mohammadi", "time": "39:36", "text": "The decision to go ahead with gender confirming surgery is undeniably a large one. Dr. Brown told us more about how the program and their team supports patients who are considering surgery."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Mitchell Brown", "time": "39:47", "text": "You know, one of the most important things to recognize is when someone moves towards surgery, they're entering the world of, of irreversible decision making. So, when you remove a breast, there's no putting it back. When you put it In an implant, you've changed the tissue, and there's no going back to the way that it was before necessarily. So, these are critical decisions that need to be analyzed carefully. So, we're fortunate in Women's College to have a nice program where individuals that are looking for gender confirming surgery come through a program where they have had counseling, they've met with appropriate healthcare professionals to be able to discuss individuals goals and expectations and barriers and challenges. Often, individuals may have lived in the gender that they're looking to express themselves as for a period of time. They may or may not have had hormone manipulation or hormone therapy. They will have had conversations and counseling about the irreversibility of surgery and come to us usually having been quite thoughtfully and appropriately dealt with so that when we get to see them as surgeons, we're able to discuss the surgical aspects of what we're going to do. The experience that I've had is that when you perform the surgical procedures on people who have considered this carefully and have wanted this often for so long that once you provide these opportunities and these physical changes to people, it lifted a tremendous burden off their minds. I think these are some of the most grateful and appreciative and happy patients that we see."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "41:22", "text": "Although we have come a long way and seen many improvements related specifically to gender confirming surgery, there are still many gaps to be filled and steps to be taken. We spoke with Sly but the challenges remaining today. "}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "41:32", "text": "So, Ontario started covering gender confirming surgery around 2016. But, has this access actually improved over the last, you know, five, six years?"}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "41:42", "text": "Yeah, it's an amazing question. I've seen some systemic barriers in that you need to have a doctor or a social worker or a nurse or a psychologist who can do the letter in support of you in order to get that funding approved. So, I've seen that like, you know, very few people are trained. There is training available, but it's often outside of the city, so and no one really knows. It's not really clear. Do I take a workshop? Do I take a training? You can actually read the WPATH guidelines, a World Professional Association for Transgender Health, and be educated and have resources to assess people or support them, but I notice the backlog in terms of the supportive letter piece, which is what people need in order to get the funding. And also, once they get the funding, a lot of the surgeons now have extremely long waitlists, because more people have funding, so now, people are getting their funding, they actually, the ministry had to extend it for an additional year, because waitlist for to access a surgeon are now two years long or and then for various different surgeries."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "42:45", "text": "When someone is seeking gender confirming surgery, is it entirely covered by the government? Or do they have to do, they have to pay for some of that themselves?"}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "42:53", "text": "So top surgery, actually for, for transplant in top surgery is, is, is barely covered, and that is a, that's a really crummy sort of piece there. I'm not sure what, why the government has determined that, for trans women, breasts are optional, but that's a really glaring, discriminatory piece that's sort of embedded in how funding gets sorted out. So, it's very rare that women will get funding for breast augmentation. So, there's a funding piece for trans masculine people who are pursuing top surgery. Most of the surgeries covered, I believe, they're still, sometimes, with different surgeons. Depending on who you're with, you might have to pay $2,000 out of pocket for the anesthesiologist. You have to check with the surgeon as to where that's at. Sometimes it's covered. It varies from surgeon to surgeon. Everything outside of your medical experience, as well, is not covered. So, time off work, if you don't have benefits is not covered, if you are seeking care outside of your province or outside of your city or outside of the country, the travel expenses, and the time that you spend in a country recovering, everything related to that is not covered. So, Your flight ticket, if you have to return to the surgeon, if you have complication or repair, you know, you have to pay for that out of pocket. So, those things are not covered. But lower surgery, the surgery itself is largely covered. And that is a huge chunk of funding. It is fantastic."}, {"speaker": "Nathan Chan", "time": "44:15", "text": "Is there anything that you're looking forward to, in particular with health or surgical advances in trans and non-binary health?"}, {"speaker": "Sly Sarkisova", "time": "44:22", "text": "I mean, I think we've had amazing advances so far. I think the procedures are evolving in terms of technique. And, I would love to see more money, funding research into different ways of doing surgery. I think, you know, I'm not a medical professional. I don't know how it's evolved so far, but sort of been surgeon to surgeon, and they've sort of evolved their own technique, and they become masters at it, and then that has set the bar for other folks. But, it'd be really great to have more research and funding for trans healthcare in general to know what works and what doesn't and to evolve. I'm sure we have the means to do it, but we just don't have the political will, maybe, to fund it. So, we could probably advance care outrageously, amazingly, very quickly if we threw a bit more money into research, but that would, that be something I would be looking forward to."}, {"speaker": "Atefeh Mohammadi", "time": "45:13", "text": "We also asked Dr. Brown if there was anything he was looking forward to with regards to trans and non-binary health."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Mitchell Brown", "time": "45:20", "text": "Well, the answer is always yes. You never want to be stagnant in surgery. You want to look for developments and ways to do what we do today but to do it better. I think one of the things that we're paying close attention to is how to assist in the identification of individuals at an earlier stage in life. We work collaboratively with the Hospital for Sick Children. We see a number of individuals that come to us as teenagers from Sick Children's Hospital. They've undergone counseling and therapy related to their gender identity and can imagine that the challenges of going through puberty. When you're developing in a certain way physically that is different from how you identify internally is a tremendous challenge. And, we're trying to find ways to identify those individuals earlier and assist them as best as we can through those critical formative times. From a purely surgical point of view, yes, we're always looking at how can we do things that look better, that provide less stigma of surgery, that provide fewer scars, how to create a female breast form that may not be as reliant on a medical device like a breast implant and better ways to use fat and stem cells to almost regenerate or build tissue. So, there's tremendous change on the horizon. We look at things that we may use for feminization of the face, fillers, injectables, Botox... I mean a variety of ancillary small procedures, if you will, but added up, they make quite a difference in the end. So, there's constant change, and we certainly look to continue to evolve."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "47:10", "text": "Dr. Brown is optimistic about the future accessibility of these services for trans folks.

And as I was finishing my doctoral work, I got what I thought was my dream job, which was a sports psychology consultant for a team of athletes that were headed into the Olympics. I thought this is a fabulous opportunity. And most of them were young female gymnasts, and I was asked to work with these athletes to make them a little more mentally tough, more resilient. Some of them were crying in training or losing their skills. And my job was to help them with these things. And then I discovered by talking to these young people, that there weren't any issues with them, that they were responding quite appropriately to situations that no young person should have to endure. And so I thought, Well, what do I do? Do I teach them coping skills so they can just go back and try and deal with the abuse they were suffering? Or do I try and change the sporting practices that led to the abuse, and so I fell into the whole area of athlete maltreatment. I tried to work with the coaches and the sport administrators to suggest that there were healthier methods to develop talent in young people. And their response was of course quickly to fire me. So that was a very important lesson, you know, I lost that position. But at the same time, I couldn't stay within that system and work within their conditions. So then I turned my research to athlete maltreatment, and trying to affect coach education so that different strategies would be incorporated."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "6:19", "text": "Dr. Kerr defines maltreatment as an umbrella term that consists of physical, sexual and psychological abuse, as well as neglect, harassment and bullying.

And it's focused on young people primarily, in in educational settings, or others. But curiously, there's been very little research done on bullying in sport or sport teams. And the suspicion is that's because there's such a focus on sport teams being cohesive and gelling together that there almost is an assumption that bullying wouldn't occur. We've conducted a number of studies within the last five years primarily with inter-university teams, and have discovered, not surprisingly, that bullying does exist. And bullying in sport differs a little bit from bullying outside of sport, because it tends to be based on ability. So even if you're a senior member of the team, but you don't have the same ability, you're going to be bullied. So it was less so about seniority on the team. As it was  athletic ability."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "8:10", "text": "Dr. Kerr points to a recent prevalent study that showed that maltreatment isn't an isolated issue in just a few sports.

And, in fact, the funding system used in sport in Canada is performance based. So those athletes and teams are those sports that do particularly well, internationally get more funding, and those that don't do as well get less funding. So that leads to a climate in which there's can be a win at all costs attitude; that the focus is on the outcome, regardless of the means by which you get there. And if those means are harmful, and it still leads to a gold medal, the gold medal is what is the focus and I think the the best example of that is the Larry Nassar case in USA Gymnastics, where here we have someone who perpetrated a sexual misconduct against hundreds of athletes across decades. Some of those survivors were on the USA Olympic gold medal team. Which leads us to question two things. Well, many, many more questions. But the some of the questions that leads to include, how much better could those athletes have done if they hadn't experienced sexual abuse? How many athletes were left in the system before they got to the Olympic level because of the sexual abuse? And of course, the question of, there's no way that someone can abuse so many people over such a long period of time, without someone knowing or someone suspecting. And so it's important to look at athlete maltreatment in, in a broad way, look at the whole ecological system around sport. You know, where were the sport administrators where were the coaches where were the physiotherapists and sports psychology consultants in that case, there's lots of pressing questions. And it's not those aren't limited to the Nassar case, we've had our own Canadian examples as well."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "11:13", "text": "Another reason that athletes can be vulnerable to experiencing maltreatment, in addition to this focus on performance, is that coaching itself is not regulated in any way."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Gretchen Kerr", "time": "11:22", "text": "So there are some educational requirements within the coaching realm for coaches, but they're very minimal. And there's no regulatory body, as there is with physicians or teachers. A body that has the authority to say, you know, you've engaged in misconduct, we're taking away your license. And so what we see happen is coaches who engage in misconduct, just move from club to club or from province to province. And and that is also a barrier to dealing with this problem. We have this system in sport that kind of assumes if you've been a good athlete in that sport, you can coach, which, of course bears no resemblance to any other sector. Just because we've all been students doesn't mean we can teach, for example, so but making coaching more professional and having a regulatory body I think would also be helpful. It's not the only answer, but it's a piece of the puzzle."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "12:28", "text": "Maltreatment is a widespread problem that is difficult to tackle, especially because it is often not reported.

And so, you know, remembering what the purpose of sport is, and educating around that, I think the other thing is at the elite level, there's nothing wrong with focusing on winning, aiming for the medals in the standings. But to think more deeply and critically about how to produce those outcomes. So rather than thinking that we have to yell and scream and be critical of athletes in order to make them mentally tough, to look at, how do we make them as whole and as well as possible, because when, when any of us thinks about when we perform the best at whatever- school, our jobs, in our relationships, it's when we feel good about ourselves and we feel supported. And so, you know, just imagine the athletic performances, we might see if athletes had that kind of support and foundation to produce those those performance outcomes."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "14:11", "text": "Different coaching styles and strategies can have a huge impact on an athlete's psychological experience and performance.

It's also of interest to note that the way coaches are portrayed in the media, particularly the most popular sport films, you know, Coach Carter, and those types of films all illustrate the coach as being quite autocratic, yelling, screaming using punitive strategies and so on. And this is what we call controlling coaching style."}, {"speaker": "Coach Carter", "time": "15:00", "text": "Gentlemen you told me you deserve to be here! Well you're not playing like it. All season long, we play our game- right now, you're playing theirs! When we step on the floor, every second that clock is ticking, we are pedal to the metal! We run the ball! We pressure the ball!

We've also learned that with a controlling style of coach, there's higher dropout rates. So we mustn't forget about all of those young people who could have reaped the benefits of sport participation, but dropped out because of these controlling coaching methods. So on the flip side, what's encouraged in the literature and borne out by research is what we call athlete centered coaching or humanistic coaching or democratic coaching. Lots of words are used for this. But it's it's as it suggests, it's focused on the athletes health and well being first and foremost. It's a style that involves athletes in decision making at an age or developmentally appropriate way. It considers the athletes well being not just while they're in the sport, but in an extended responsibility way. So a coach who coaches in athlete centered way asks the question, How are the experiences that young person is having today, going to affect their development long after they've left sport, and that's a critical piece."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "17:08", "text": "Speaking of different coaching styles, and what works best for youth athletes, Steph had the pleasure of speaking with Karl Subban."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "17:16", "text": "You may recognize him and his family as they have become a household name, specifically his eldest son, the Olympian and NHL hockey player, PK Subban, who's known both on and off the ice for his talent, charisma and generosity."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "17:29", "text": "Mr. Subban is the ultimate hockey dad. despite never having played the sport himself, the high school principal and father of five has raised three professional players, including two currently playing in the NHL,"}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "17:41", "text": "Mr. Subban shared his experience and advice for developing elite athletes and achieving your potential."}, {"speaker": "Karl Subban", "time": "17:49", "text": "I've spent my life working with children, I call it in three worlds, the world of education, the world of coach, because I've spent a lot of time coaching children in many sports, and obviously, the world of parenting, you know, obviously, I'm a parent everyday still a parent, and now a grandparent. So I've spent my life working with children. And the one thing I've learned the one takeaway, I think the most important one is working with children to help them to believe in their potential, and then supporting them to fulfill that potential, I think that is the most important work. And once you have that mindset, you just don't know where it's gonna take you. And that's how I think how our story played out. Because, you know, when you look at potential and the parts about having a dream, and it's so important for young people, to have a dream, and my kids have a dream, and, you know, and but you just never know what's gonna take you. And so it has taken them to where they, they want it to go. And but we know that not every dream is fulfilled, just like not every tree will bear fruits, but that tree serves a purpose. And so they fulfill their dreams, they continue to learn and grow. But even if they didn't reach their destination, it you know, that journey still serves a purpose. In terms of peak performance. No parent, or I never did, I can't speak for every parent. But we didn't start out raising our children to be NHLers, you know, we didn't start out raising them to be educators with my, which my daughters are. I mean, we started out spending time with them. You know, and and so that was the the key. I don't mind saying this. I've said it many times before. People want like they've asked me, did PK love skating? At two and a half and three and four? Yeah, I think you enjoyed the activity. But what I can say is that he loved being with his parents. That time with him, is what he looked forward to. Yes- when he was skating, we were there. But I believe that I really believe that if mum and dad, were not there with him, I don't think he would have enjoyed it as much. Because skating, especially when you're learning to skate, it's not fun. No one loves falling down, you know what I mean. And so what he enjoyed was the time we were spending with him. And then the skating started to improve. And I remember one of these things used to say to me, Daddy, Daddy, look at me, look at me. And you could, you could see him getting better. And you could sense that he's feeling better about himself. And when our children are doing something, especially at a young age, and it allows them to feel better about themselves, geez, you know, they start to feel better about their world and their place in it, and you just never know where it's gonna take them. I think that's where it starts in terms of building, you know, elite athletes, I don't think we started out to create an annually child, or to create an Olympian and PK playing the Olympics, but it's really to to spend time with them and develop that relationship with them. That is so important. You know, that's the foundation."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "21:11", "text": "What are different kinds of motivation in sport? And how did his children and he himself as a parent, stay motivated during their journeys in sports?"}, {"speaker": "Karl Subban", "time": "21:19", "text": "People always wanted to know, if I really pushed my kids to skate. Did I really push them out hard, if I did, hard did I push them. But I often say that Maria and I, that's my wife, Maria, we push them more in the baby carriage than push them to skate. Okay. And, and so but I also on the other hand, I've said that I've never met a child or work with a child who could not have use some pushing. Right? I've never, but if you spend all of your time pushing them, they'll never end up where you want them to be in life. The trick is to inspire them. Parents, the trick is to inspire them, and see motivation. I can motivate PK, but unless he's inspired, it's not gonna last. Motivation is just that a thing that happens now, inspiration is more long term. It's like the long distance is like the marathon. That's what happens when you're inspired. You know, I can motivate you to run, and you do it quickly. And it's done. And so how do we inspire our children because it's not motivating them, it's inspiring them and inspiring them. It's something that happens from the inside, you know, so the trick was for us, and I said it, I said it before, and I'll say it again, it started out with spending time with them, spending time with them. If I said PK go and shoot pucks in the basement, maybe he'd go once or twice, but he's not gonna he's not gonna do it five or six times a week. And he did it because we were there with him. When he was shooting pucks in the basement. I was there with him or mom was there with them. When Taz and chip Taz, you our eldest daughter, nastasia, play basketball at York University. And she was a pretty good player as many records. But we were there with her in the basement when she's doing her dribbling drills, or we take her to the park, you know, we're there with them. Because kids at a young age, they want your attention. And they want your time. And so that's where the inspiration starts. You know, and, and so it starts out with them, loving the fact that you're there. And eventually, they'll start loving what they're doing more than the fact that that our mom's there. You know what I mean? They're not looking out for me as much as they grow older. And that's why I like to say to parents, you know, you're clear the way paved the way and get out of the way. You know, when I saw we started out clearing the way, and then we pave the way then you get out of the way, you know, when PK was young, and I use PK, because everyone knows him. I would carry his hockey bag at one time for him because it was way bigger and heavier than him. And he wasn't strong enough. But I but I can you I always ask this question. Can you imagine if I was still carrying his hockey bag at 14? You know what I mean? And so that's inspiration now- now he wants to carry his bag. I don't have to tell him to there is a point in time around 14. Now between 12 and 14, I didn't have to tell him about the importance of working out. I didn't have to tell him to go train. I didn't have to tell him to go shoot parks. That's inspiration. He's inspired. He has, he has found the passion. He has found his calling. And once kids find their passion, and they find that thing they love to do. We don't have to tell them to do it."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "24:44", "text": "Environments and higher level sports are competitive, it can be quite intense. What are some strategies for keeping a positive mindset?"}, {"speaker": "Karl Subban", "time": "24:51", "text": "You know what we want young people to believe in themselves. Okay, and because if you don't believe in yourself, how are you going to fulfill your potential? How will you use those gifts you have to do better in this world. And so sometimes young people will believe in themselves. But we know that we have many who don't. And so I like to tell them to believe in their potential, because and that's why it's so important for young people to know what they're good at. You know, PK, and I use him as an example, he knew what he was good at, at a very young age before he was five, before he was three. And even probably before he could articulate it. He was good at skating. That's one thing he was good at. When children know what they're good at, wow, they become so much better at doing things in school, and in life, that that feeling is transferable to other aspect. And, and so to me, that's how they grew confidence. And that's all they, they will grow that belief in themselves. Potential looks like a three legged stool. It looks like a stool with three legs. I want everyone here to imagine everyone listening, I want you to draw a three legged stool in your mind. In the seat of it. I want you to write the word potential. One leg is a dream leg, that's the first that's an important part of potential having a dream. The middle leg is your belief system is your belief leg. The third leg is your action leg. Because a dream without action. What are you doing? You're just daydreaming. So that's what potential looks like. And so it's that confidence, and that belief in yourself and in your potential, that, \"Wow\", it makes you powerful. And that helps you to take on that helps you to deal with adversity. Because as you chase that dream, you know the part of potential, you're going to have doubts or people who doubt you, you will have setbacks, you will have challenges. And and so because you believe in your potential, and and because that feeling that you get from knowing what you're good at, and from working to be better, that helps you deal with those that help you to deal with adversities.

That sport can help with and and there's a large body of research that looks at life skill development through sport so that evidence is certainly there. And on the flip side, we know that sport also has the potential to lead to very harmful experiences, maltreatment being one of them. In our latest national prevalence study of athlete maltreatment, we found that the athletes reported connections between their experiences of abuse and neglect. with mental health challenges, like depression and anxiety, eating disorders and disordered eating was a huge piece of that puzzle. And so there are clear ramifications of the very prevalent experiences of abuse and neglect. They often play out in terms of mental health of athletes. The other important piece to note is very few athletes actually report their experiences of abuse and neglect. In fact, less than 10% of our sample of 1000 athletes ever reported their experiences. Now, some of these experiences were characterized by psychological abuse, some with neglect, and some was sexual abuse. And even in the recent disclosure by Megan Brown, a U of T, former U of T athlete track and field athlete who alleges her coach at Guelph engaged in underage sexual relationship with her. She didn't disclose it until, you know, years and years later. And athletes don't disclose or report because of fear of what it will mean for their athletic careers, that they may get their funding cut or they won't get chosen for a team, they're very clear that they don't have a safe place to take their concerns where they won't be punished as a result of reporting."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "32:00", "text": "Luckily, we are moving towards improving how we address and prevent maltreatment."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Gretchen Kerr", "time": "32:05", "text": "There is a large movement afoot to lobby the government and sport Canada to create an independent body for athletes to report, where there is an independent body to establish mechanisms to investigate complaints, and to sanction where sanctions are called for.

So the increase in awareness, you know, has been great nonetheless, there persist some of these myths, or you weren't hit in the head, you're not concussed whatever. Those those are much less than they were 20 or 30 years ago. The difficulties we face now are, you know, swimming in a sea of ignorance. I mean, we don't really have a super great handle on all the different types or components of pathology that exists within what really is a clinical syndrome, the concussion syndrome because it's a heterogenous beast, there are multiple different components of pathological anatomy that occur with different concussions and, and there may be subtypes based on pathology, but all of this pathology that we learn about from animal models and autopsies and, and some very fancy and expensive MRIs and MR spectroscopy that we can do clinically, is not applicable to clinical care. So, you know, I think, as we learn more about the biology and we improve the diagnosis of concussion to include diagnosis of the of the pathology, rather than just treating it as a purely clinical syndrome, you've got symptoms, you have a concussion because that's still where we're at and in 2020, for the most part, that the treatment will improve."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "37:55", "text": "Dr. Richards mentioned Rowan's law in Ontario, which is the very first concussion legislation in Canada passed in 2018."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "38:02", "text": "Which Swapna's research is playing a pivotal role in informing."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "38:26", "text": "The first is that they ensure that athletes aged 26 and under the parents of athletes aged 18 and under coaches, trainers and officials all confirm that they have reviewed the concussion awareness resources each and every year."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "38:41", "text": "Secondly, establishment of a concussion code of conduct that outlines rules and expectations for behavior to help support prevention of concussions and help foster a culture change towards recognizing and reporting concussions and away from behaviors that can contribute to concussion risk.

Other extrinsic factors include the use of safety equipment to mitigate the risk of some injury. So you know, wear a helmet when you're cycling, and you're less likely to die. rules that are based on safety, not hitting the head or checking from behind in hockey, etc. and playing in a safe venue not you know, playing basketball on a paid surface full of broken glass and dirty needles. Intrinsically, we look at people's movement capacity. Those are the main intrinsic variables, there are quite a number, I mean, things like age, and mass and sex are all intrinsic variables that contribute to risk someone. But things that you can do something about are your strength, your flexibility, your motor control, and I think that is the most important one, your ability to control your body in three dimensional space under the influences of gravity and inertia. And to be able to hold your body in correct positions and move your joints in correct sequences in correct alignment. That's what I was talking about poor quality running, the primary fault is to allow the hip to rotate in, bringing the knee medial to or inward from the foot, and the arch of the foot collapses. And this pattern of movement, which is exceedingly common, it happens to all of us, to some extent, is probably the single biggest movement quality issue causing injuries in sport- is poor running, where the knee comes in and the hip rotates internally. So we have the research on this is recent, actually just we're talking about the last couple of decades, and it's evolving and it's at the point where people are doing studies attempting to show prospectively and randomized with controls etc. that doing exercises to strengthen hip external rotators and abductor muscles that strengthening these muscles, improves running quality and reduces the risk of these extremely common overuse problems like Runner's knee, and tibial stress fractures and plantar fasciitis at the end, the list goes on."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "43:38", "text": "Movement quality really matters."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Doug Richards", "time": "43:40", "text": "\"Quality is job one\" to quote an old ad campaign from Ford motors."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "43:45", "text": "Speaking of moving quality, this aligns with the seven key features of movement that fellow U of T Faculty of Kinesiology and physical education professors and bio mechanist, Dr. Dave Frost and Tyson Beach promote for good movement quality."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "43:57", "text": "These features are things that folks can keep in mind in their everyday lives as well as in sport whenever they're moving and regardless of age."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "44:05", "text": "There are two for the knee, three for the back, and two for the shoulders.

He talks a bit about his experience with the team, and as a physician and a professional sport league."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Doug Richards", "time": "45:17", "text": "I was with them for nine years from the beginning of the franchise in 1995 until the end of the 2004 season and a little while into the summer, I was the primary care physician with the team, the head team physician was Dr. Paul marks the orthopedic surgeon with the team and the two of us worked as partners taking care of the team. As much as I would like to say it was my role to prevent injuries with the team, (it most certainly was not) at that point in the evolution of the franchise, the strength and conditioning, which is really where you get out injury prevention is movement quality and strength and conditioning. And I hate to use the term load management but you know, it wasn't invented by either the Raptors or kawhi. Leonard, it's, it's been around for eons. But gradually progressing with physical activities and and strengthening people appropriately. That was primarily the responsibility of the strength and conditioning coaches, and to a lesser extent, the head trainer, as he was called, or the head therapist who worked with us as physicians, but it's not like we were consulted on what the guy's programs would be, we would sometimes say, hey, this, this was usually in reaction to an injury. If somebody gets jumpers knee, then we'd have a discussion about what sort of squatting or lunging they're doing, and whether they're focused on different phases of the movement, whether they're doing it with one leg or two, and how much weight and how many reps they're doing. But it's not like that was that we were involved in that daily. Since that time, professional sport medicine has evolved in a favorable direction to mimic the Olympic model. It was at the Olympic level that the notion of an integrated support team first arose, and that you should have a team of people working together rather than an isolated silos to do what's best for both health and performance capacity on the team. And an integrated support team needs to have a physician, a therapist, physiologist, a bio mechanist, a strength and conditioning coach, a mental performance consultant, a mental health professional, a coach, the coach has to buy in or doesn't work. So back then we'd loosely had an nice team but we didn't meet. We didn't. When I was with the Raptors, we didn't do physiological testing. I was doing with the Olympic teams I was working for but not with the professional team. They weren't interested. Well, no, they wanted, you know, I got told what they wanted. When we started, they said okay, we want everyone to have a stress test and a stress echocardiogram. And I'm like, why do you need all that? You don't need to stress that going, everybody? Yes, we do- this is the NBA. Completely medically unnecessary. But it was the standard of care in the league."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "47:58", "text": "The athletes best interest health wise doesn't always line up with the interests of a team or league. So what happens when that's the case, Dr. Richard saw this happen during his time with the Raptors, and talks about his thought process, and he explains it through the triangular contractual arrangement."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Doug Richards", "time": "48:15", "text": "So I have a doctor patient relationship that is one edge of the triangle, but I have a doctor team relationship, that's another edge and then there's a team athlete relationship. And it is very clear in American law, it's not legislated, but they have a body of case law that makes it clear that the doctors do not actually decide anything, we do not have authority to dictate, you know, Thou shalt not play or thou shalt play. The people who decide whether or not not an athletes gonna play are the other two corners of the triangle, the athlete has to be willing to play or not, and the team has to be willing to put them on the court or ice or field or not. The exception to that which exists only in Ontario (and Canada now) is concussion and Rowan's law, where legislation, (thank you Swapna) has invested authority in the physician. But outside of that legislation, there is no legislated or case law authority invested in the physician, the physician is an advisor to the other two parties. So I could advise an athlete I don't think you should play because of these risks to your health. And I can tell the team I don't think that athletes should play because of those risks to the team. Now, with many teams that I work with, including all teams at the University of Toronto, where it is department policy, that the coach will follow the physician's advice. So then that invests authority in the physician because the sport organization has invested that authority in them and you and then then the coach tells the athlete you have to we have to follow the doc's advice. That is not the case at the professional level. And certainly my advice was always overwritten by both athletes and coaches in the NBA, you know where I give my best advice and say, I think this is what should happen. They're like, thanks, Doc. And then it's their right to decide. So positions are advisors, that is legally the case at the amateur level, except that at the amateur level, such as at university, and even with the Olympic Games I work with, as a matter of policy, the team follows the doctor's advice. But that's the team's decision to do that, not the doctor's decision."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "50:29", "text": "Dr. Richards shared how he has seen decisions play out in the professional world.

So even faced with the evidence that you know, you risk having problems later in life, whether it's arthritis or dementia, or whatever it is. I had one Raptor, tell me once, when I said, you know, if you do this, you're not going to be able to walk when you're 50. He said, that's fine, Doc, I'll be able to afford an electric wheelchair to take my money to the bank. He's right, he's a multimillionaire, and he can afford multiple electric wheeled cars and Tesla's and whatever. And so he knew that he was going to give himself near therosis. But he was willing to accept that if he was being driven purely by a health perspective that he wanted to maintain the cartilage in his knees for as long as he couldn't live, so he could dance it as grandkids wedding, he wouldn't have made that choice.

But what is load management?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Doug Richards", "time": "51:51", "text": "Load management, when applied to someone who has a chronic injury is a different concept and different beast than load management to prevent injury. Load management in healthy individuals, is well informed by research that is occurred over the last couple of decades. And the most important principle is the rate of progression of activity. In fact, that research suggests there's no limit to how much activity you can do. And there's no such thing as quotes \"overuse\", because you can run more, it's just like there's no limit to weekly mileage beyond which no one can run without injury. It's a question of how they get there, they have to run well, first quality again, quality is job one. And then they have to progress, the mileage of their running at a suitable rate, such as not more than a 5% per week increase. And we also worry about them taking off too much time during the downtime, because if they go down to zero for two months, they have to start from scratch to build up again. And you can't come in and start the season at full speed. So you need to stay in shape in the offseason. All of that is load management of healthy individuals to prevent injury."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "53:03", "text": "What about in people managing and existing chronic injury."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Doug Richards", "time": "53:06", "text": "So it is a tertiary strategy for coping with incurable disorder of some kind, I presume. And we certainly had people like that on the Raptors, people who had holes in the cartilage in their knees, where if they ran, if they played more than 18 minutes a game their knee would swell. You can't plan for 20 because it was pretty much a guarantee. If he ran for 20, his knee would swell. And we knew he had pathology and he had holes in his articular cartilage and so on. And this stuff was incurable. So managing his load was about preventing his incurable disorder from flaring up to the point where he couldn't run and play,"}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "53:42", "text": "Sport culture and what has been accepted continues to change across time, positively, we're moving towards increasingly prioritizing the health of athletes, both physically and mentally."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Gretchen Kerr", "time": "53:52", "text": "You know, people are questioning what's been traditionally accepted as just the culture of sport. I don't think you know, people are going to be saying, that's just the way sport is any longer. They've all been forced to self reflect on these practices that we've traditionally accepted in sport, first of all, are harmful. They're not okay anymore. And very importantly, they're not representative of practices used in other sectors where young people reside and work. Teaching strategies have moved from those kind of punitive controlling methods to being child centered and democratic. Parenting has moved from using physical punishment and autocratic styles to more democratic child centered parenting. And I think this has been a wake up call for sport to get in line with the rest of Canadian society's expectations and standards around how young people should be treated. Most Most of the headlines we see in the papers about abuse in sport has to do with sexual abuse. And our prevalence study as well as other prevalence studies have indicated that it's actually the psychological abuse that is the most prevalent. And that's, I think, going to be the hard one to tackle because that's the part that's normalized. That's the yelling, screaming coach, that's athletes exercised for punitive reasons until they collapse. It's those kinds of psychologically abusive practices that are really being challenged now. There's been too many, you know, headline stories in this country, about young people in particular, going into sport because it's supposed to be this wonderful environment for growth and well being and development of skills to be used later on in life, and finding that there are environments characterized by abuse and neglect. So it's, it's led to, I think, everybody in the sport community, regardless of level, contemplating what we do now and how we can do better. And that's a great opportunity. There are new educational tools being created. There's been a universal Code of Conduct established for all stakeholders in sport across the country, there are new mechanisms being developed to enable athletes to have a safe place to go to report their concerns. So as much as it is a crisis, it's leading to some very productive and positive outcomes."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "56:54", "text": "As we're seeing perspectives on maltreatment change for the better.

When I started, it's become more formalized, the educational programs have become more formalized. they've evolved. I think we are. And this is really good news. From my perspective, we are seeing an evolution toward the exercise side of what we now call Sport and Exercise medicine, that it's not mostly about taking care of high performance athletes. It's mostly about fostering healthy exercise, or fostering health through exercise, exercise medicine, and applicable to the broader population. So the educational programs are changing their focus that way, it's not that we're not going to still take care of athletes, there'll still be a sport medicine component as long as people play games, but everyone should be exercising not just people who are playing competitive games. And so some need for health care in relation to the issues that arise around regular chronic physical activity are important, and every physician needs to know something about it."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "58:17", "text": "To hear even more from Dr. Richards, you can check out Episode Three of season one of medicine in motion podcast, and the rest of their shows for even more content on all things movement, and health."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "58:28", "text": "Check out the show notes for a link."}, {"speaker": "Karl Subban", "time": "58:32", "text": "The important thing that I'd like to give to listeners is this.

Although the idea of music as therapy has been ancient, I mean, the idea that music has some kind of medical or therapeutic value, it's been probably around for thousands of years. If you look at sort of the artifacts, it was obviously not very scientific. And still, some of the popular concepts about music and housing therapy are still not very scientific, although they become more and more popular. But the first country, to my knowledge that actually organized a profession of music therapy was the US in 1950. It came out of the music educators organization, they had a music psychology section, and the music psychology section, it created the society, National Society for music therapy. And it actually started practicing during World War Two, when musicians were invited to go into hospitals, and play for the patients. And so some of the results they saw were, obviously beyond the entertainment idea.

So that in and of itself is unique. When people see me in the elevator with a keyboard, or a violin or a guitar, it's often striking because it's not what you would typically expect in health care facility. However, I'm a firm believer that human beings are inherently musical by virtue of the fact that our bodies are quite rhythmic. We have a drum - our heart inside us, and we move through the world in a rhythmic, melodic way. So there is definitely a unique aspect of being a music therapist and that I am bringing live music to the bedside and doing various things with it through psychotherapy. However, once people start to connect their emotions to music, they find it's a very natural extension of processing what it means to be dealing with an illness or to be coping with cancer in general. A typical music therapy session generally involves some component of live music, as well as some component of talk therapy. It depends on where the patient's at and what their symptom levels are like. I've been in patient rooms where they are so fatigued, they don't want to talk, they're sort of talked out. So I may come in, and I may play live music for 20 to 30 minutes, sometimes as few as five minutes, sometimes as many as 60 minutes. I will be at the bedside with my keyboard. And I will do something called breath in treatment, where I will match the person's breathing patterns. They may be lying in bed or in a chair. And I will play music that matches the speed at which they are breathing. And what happens in that process is subconsciously the patient's breathing will match up with the speed of the music I'm playing. And effectively if I slow the music down, their breathing will slow down, calming their nervous system, relaxing their body. I draw on familiar music if patients have very specific songs or artists or genres that they love. But I also do a lot of improvisation. I may use my voice, I may use only the piano, I may use a different instrument completely. So that could be a typical kind of receptive music therapy session. A more active session might involve something like songwriting, where I go in and do a fair bit of verbal psychotherapy, where I'm exploring patients' thoughts, feelings, emotions, and I invite them to put those into words. And then we put the words to music. That can happen in a period of 20 minutes, that can happen over a period of a month if a patient wants to spend more time. But often patients don't necessarily have a lot of time depending on how long they are hospitalized, or if they are physically declining and find it exhausting to engage verbally. So I always take my lead from the patients and go with what their needs are as well as what the clinical focuses from the team."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "8:43", "text": "SarahRose works in cancer and end of life care.

Sometimes I vocalize with the singing bowl, sometimes not. After that, I usually do around of a check-in. So each person can kind of share how they're doing today, or how they've been doing this feeling this week, and just be able to share that with the group, and it's received by the group members supportively. Or it could be a musical check-in so taking an instrument, and playing something and then talking about what that represents, what feeling it may represent. And then I like to go into a musical experience, such as sound layering. So that would be where each person creates a little sound bite on their instrument, and it could be really simple, just hitting the drum, doing a steady beat on the drum, for example. And something that's simple enough, they can continue to repeat. And then after they start that, each person will consecutively add their sound bite so that by the end, everybody's playing. Then it becomes this really interesting sound of all these instruments and the patterns that they're doing. And I sometimes tell people, if you start something, and after a few moments, you don't like it anymore, feel free to change it. It ends organically by when you're done, you just drop out, and eventually one person's left playing, and then it ends. And we talk about, you know, what that might have felt like. Were you listening to others? Were you pretty absorbed in what you were playing? Did you make any changes? Yes, no, maybe, why? So that's one kind of example of a structured improvisation. And then we might go into more referential or more open improvisations, where, for example, we come up with a theme. So the theme could be an emotion, the theme could be anything that the group is feeling right now is important to explore through music. So if it was an emotion, for example, we might start with an overall feeling that people are having, feeling tired or sad or frustrated. Anything. And then we maybe explore that emotion through music, and add in the option to shift to another emotion. And so we'll bring down the music discuss it, what came on. And then sometimes, if there's a theme for the day, I like to use that as a prompt to do some creative writing. And then we might turn that creative writing into a song afterwards. So let's say the prompt was: today we're exploring the inner child. And the creative writing project might be: what is something you want to say to your inner child? And then there's opportunity for each person to share, if they want. And then we'll brainstorm, taking some of those words, putting them on paper, and then turning it into a song somehow. So the song doesn't have to be, you know, a traditional verse, chorus, verse. Sometimes it is, but sometimes it could be just an instrument playing in the background. So maybe I'm playing the keyboard or the piano or something. And each person's going around and seeing a line that really resonates with them, so singing or speaking that line. And so it turns into more of a spoken word piece. So it really depends. But sometimes it is like a full, some verse, chorus verse, and everybody's in the room is singing, and it's playing percussion while they're doing that. So that's one example. Other times I incorporate art as well. With art as a prompt for improvisation or as a prompt to do some storytelling, about people's experiences related to the theme that we're exploring. So it really varies. I often like to close with singing, because I find that as the singing bowl grounds us and brings us into the space, sometimes singing also has the same function to bring everybody together again, before we all disperse, and to have us feeling unified, especially if what was brought up in the group was challenging. It's a good way to kind of bring everyone back together again. And then we do a checkout where we sing sometimes the chorus of \"Let It Be\", and then each person has a chance to kind of share something for their closing checkout as the music's playing in the background. So it kind of provides like an accompaniment for their checkout. "}, {"speaker": "Eryn Tong", "time": "14:19", "text": "Priya has learned a lot about music therapy in practice. And she says she continues to learn each and every day, in every client and patient encounter. We asked her about her key takeaways when describing the important elements of music therapy."}, {"speaker": "Priya Shah", "time": "14:32", "text": "There are three elements to music therapy: the therapeutic relationship (so the relationship between client and therapist), music, and clinical goals. And I think the latter is super important, because in every relationship I have, whether it's with an individual client or with a group, I always have goals, and I'm reassessing constantly after each session, how these goals are being met. And so for example, let's say I'm looking at one of the groups that I run. One of the goals is for emotional expression. So I'm looking at how is music able to help clients identify and express their emotions? Another one could be building self awareness and gaining insight. So how could the music we make compared to or relate to their experiences outside of music therapy? And can connections be made between what we're learning through the process of making music and discussing a discussion afterwards? Can links be made that relate to how they're doing in recovery or how they are on their journey? In music, oftentimes,  there can be chaos, especially an improvised music, but there can also be moments of harmony and unity, and cohesion. And so how does that relate to outside? Well, life itself is nonlinear. And there's ups and downs, constantly. So music or improvisation especially allows for challenging motions to arise, but also to stay with those emotions, because that's sometimes the hardest part - to stay with those challenging emotions and to ride through those waves as they come up. And so being in that together in a supportive environment can really allow people to develop the tools to cope with those emotions as they come up and to relate it to what's happening for them outside of the room.

And I'm actually part of several teams - so part of the Department of Supportive Care, which encompasses fields like psychiatry, psychology, and social work. But I also work closely with nursing, with physicians, Allied Health, such as physiotherapists, and occupational therapists, as well as spiritual care. And within all of these different teams that I am a part of, I get formal referrals from any number of clinicians. So a nurse might refer a patient to me because the patient is having trouble sleeping or trouble managing their pain, or is very, very anxious. A physician might refer their patient to me because they are looking for alternative or complementary methods of symptom control. For example, nausea. Music can act as a distraction from symptoms, but also a way to integrate what they are feeling into a form of self expression, and it can be a really unique opportunity to say what they're feeling and thinking in a different way. I may have a referral from a spiritual care professional who notices that the patient is really interested in music and finds music very comforting, particularly with dealing with themes of existential distress, fear, loneliness, music can often be a great comfort. And sometimes I will have patients self refer or family members see me in the hall and say, \"can you come see my loved one?

And she was so excited about the things that she saw, that instead of going in and doing sing alongs with the patients, I was actually going in and having them playing instruments and working on rehabilitation of arm function after a stroke, or working on attention after a traumatic brain injury. And so it was actually very relatable for her because as an occupational therapist, that's how she imagined also that music could be used. It wasn't until I did my Master's degree and met Michael Thaut, that we started looking further at how can music really be used in a consistent way.

And so the question was, who can do that? Because the traditional music therapist does not do that. They work from a different model, more of a social science model. And so we actually had to get to the point where there was a Academy of Neurologic Music Therapy formed, and whose purpose is to continue education all over the world. So that's been going on for 20 years, currently about 3000, maybe three or 4000, certified neurologic music therapists or people from other professions that hold an NMT certificate in about 30, a little over 30 countries in the world."}, {"speaker": "Jilian Macklin", "time": "21:21", "text": "Wow.

And how can we use that knowledge to actually change brains, depending on what the need area is?"}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "22:54", "text": "We asked Corene to walk us through one of the 20 clinical techniques of NMT: melodic intonation therapy. This technique is used in speech and language training, specifically,"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Corene Hurt-Thaut", "time": "23:05", "text": "Melodic intonation therapy is actually a technique developed by neuroscientists in the 70s. And it was looking at this idea of how they could create a structured process to use music to help people with aphasia. So helping somebody who had expressive aphasia who could no longer speak and tapping into that ability that they often have to still sing, and utilizing that to teach them not to just sing familiar songs, but to actually sing functional phrases that they may need to be able to say in their everyday lives. It's one of 20 techniques. But MIT was originally developed by speech therapy. And so it was often used by them in clinical practice. However, over the years, that has really changed in how we use it just based on how long people are actually in hospitals, and what kinds of other aspects of health care and our increased knowledge. So we include it in the neurologic music therapy taxonomy because it is such an effective treatment. But I want to make sure that the credit goes to the speech therapist, who really originally designed to the technique. I'll tell you about the six steps. What we want to do first is create sentences that we know that this person would want to be able to say, and so we can talk to the patient. And obviously, if they're having difficulty speaking, the family becomes a really good resource for what would you like your loved one to be able to say in their everyday life? What would help make things easier or less frustrating? So from there, we create a list of sentences. And we think about what the melody of that sentence would be. So when we speak, it has to be called prosody. So it has this prosody melodic component to it. And so we put the speech to a melodic melody and or the sentence to a melodic melody. And we tap the client's hand as we sing them out or as we hum the melody. So we help them kind of prime and internalize that melody. And as we tap their hand, we're trying to stimulate the motor strip, which is close to the Broca's area, or the speech area that we're trying to activate. So as we're tapping the client's hand, we'll hum and just help them learn the melody we're going to use. And then we would add the words to that melody while they're listening. So at this point in time, in the process, the client usually knows that they can sing. And it's quite exciting when you are having difficulty speaking, but you realize that you can sync. So they'll often try to sing anything, even before they know what the words to the melody are going to be. So they start out, they listen first, and then they start joining in and singing along with you to rehearse the sentence and really internalize it and learn it. Because the idea is eventually for them to reproduce it. So as you're practicing it, as the therapist, I would start to fade out my voice and my cues to see if they've learned it and if they can initiate it on their own independently. From there, there's a little bit of a call and response between the client and the therapist. So I would sing the sentence, and then I would ask the client to sing it back to me to see if they're able to independently do that. And then the final step is to really just see if they can use that in a functional context. So it's very exciting when the client is able to sing a sentence. But can they say the sentence? And if a real situation happens when they need to use the sentence, can they actually initiate it? So that's probably the most important step of the six is that transfer? If I ask you a question, can you initiate that sentence we've been practicing?"}, {"speaker": "Eryn Tong", "time": "26:58", "text": "We wanted to hear her in action. Here's Corene with a patient."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Michael Thaut", "time": "28:40", "text": "My personal journey is actually a journey as a researcher. And so I became interested in clinical applications. And that's still part of it. 70% of my research is translational. There's also about one third, which is we're looking at still basic music perception processing in the brain. But the clinical angle sort of started maybe 25 years ago. And because when we tested people with music, we looked at memory function of dementia persons, we looked at walking movement, ability of stroke, and Parkinson, and we used music to cue them, or to help them remember things. We saw tremendous effects. And we documented that very carefully for many, many years in research, in papers that we presented. And then the question was not anymore, \"are these data correct?\" Because people had replicated that they found the same thing. They've developed other angles that were great. The question was, \"who can do it?\" And so this is when neurologic music therapy as a sort of certificate, clinical branch practice that people practice was established in around 2000. And so this has been around for 20 years. My role is to do research. So we don't really do clinical stuff in here in my research center at all. And the graduate programs we have, you have a Master's and a PhD in Music and Health Science. We don't teach therapy. We teach research skills, usually mostly clinical research skills, and obviously with focus on auditory neuroscience and also on music. So my role, I think, in all of this is to help discover and push the research agenda forward so that we have evidence-based ways to help people."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "30:43", "text": "Michael explains the basis of his research and gives us a sneak peek at what some of his work examines."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Michael Thaut", "time": "30:49", "text": "Music is a very pervasive stimulus. It's a very complex auditory stimulus, probably the most complex auditory language the brain has developed. So when we listen to music, or do any kind of musical task in the brain, the hallmark of what we see in the images is that there is a very large array of networks that are activated cortically subcortically, even from the priming aspect, you know, spinal cord, motor neurons can be triggered. So there is not a music area in the brain, rather that music stimulates a large, large network of multiple regions in the brain. And that's, of course, helpful when we look at injured brains because we are pretty sure that somehow some area that is in need of plasticity and work, so to speak, will also be impacted by music. So we have auditory areas, you have cognitive prefrontal areas, we have motor areas, parietal areas, pattern perception - the whole brain is really, really very, very active. And we do have musical tasks. My original hypothesis really came out of musicianship. I was interested in studying why musicians can plan and execute an enormous amount of rapid movements very, very fast. If you would take the musical context out of that and just say, okay, move your fingers 3000 times for one minute. In some kind of pattern, people would probably look and say, that's certainly a crazy idea. But that's exactly what a pianist does. So that was actually my original hypothesis. Then people were interested in talking to me about music therapy. The way this I see it, currently, it may not be very science-based. Let's try a different approach. Let's look at the music itself. So we started looking at the effect of rhythm, musical rhythm, auditory rhythm. Does that change how people entrain and move, and the first experiments we did were quite dramatic, and the effect is still dramatic. So a stroke patient walks with much more symmetry and much more stability. A partisan patient can walk much faster, with less freezing. So the auditory system, and that was part of the things that we saw to help discover, the auditory system is very closely linked to the motor system and to the cognitive system, and speech Language system. And so it is a very central network role in shaping an impact in other areas. And so this is how we discovered, step-by-step, these multiple translational effects of music on non-musical functions. We are doing a big study right now with St. Michael's Hospital looking at the neural basis, the brain basis why people with mild cognitive dysfunction, Alzheimer's disease, why do they remember music so much longer and autobiographical memories associated with music? So we just completed a brain imaging study that gives us some very good ideas of why these music memory networks that were built over 20, 30 years, 40 years sometimes have much more preservation and resilience built in. And so we can actually probably say that some focused neurologic music therapy interventions, to stimulating and boosting these kinds of memory networks that are embedded in general cognitive networks can give Alzheimer patients, and we tested that neuro psychologically about a year ago, can give him at least a boost. I mean, we cannot reverse obviously, the progression of the disease, but we can hopefully create a slowing down, ramping down of the progression."}, {"speaker": "Eryn Tong", "time": "34:45", "text": "In addition to the study that was just described in Alzheimers disease, Michael is overseeing 17 other research projects in NMT now, spanning many other populations and applications. These include a mechanism research study at CAMH, which uses near imaging techniques to understand why music helps Parkinson's patients walk better. His team is also working with Holland Bloorview Kids Rehab Hospital to look at how brain waves between children and their caregivers synchronize during neurologic music therapy sessions. His team is also exploring a new line of research, using a robotic kinematics system to look at optimal motor performance learning in musicians.

So for my PhD, I did a phenomenological study on the experience of music therapy within the context of assisted dying, working with and interviewing 10 patients over the course of seven months, also interviewing their primary caregiver, so a family member, usually several months after the patient's death. I also did my own reflections on what it was like to be a music therapist as part of an assisted dying process. And themes such as life reflection, immediacy of therapeutic relationship, trusting therapeutic process, and symptom management and control came up in the research. And it was really exciting, but also validating to see this as a trend in the data, so informing, hopefully, music therapy as a standard of practice within assisted dying, in the future. We currently have guidelines written about how music therapists can practice within assisted dying. And now with this new data, we're hoping to update those guidelines and encourage music therapists to make it part of their practice as they feel comfortable."}, {"speaker": "Eryn Tong", "time": "37:38", "text": "We asked SarahRose to tell us a bit more about why the use of qualitative methodology was necessary to address her research questions and exploration of music therapy in the context of medical assistance in dying."}, {"speaker": "Dr. SarahRose Black", "time": "37:49", "text": "I do believe that qualitative and quantitative research are two sides of the same coin and that they really don't exist as binaries - I think there is a huge spectrum on which we as researchers place ourselves. But at the end of the day, my deep curiosity is in patient experience. And that's something that cannot be quantitatively measured. We can try but we're never going to get quite as close as we would like to to a patient's experience, even with qualitative methodology. But the nuance the gray area, the complexity of exploring what someone feels, thinks, and sees as they are going through something that's life changing, or life ending. It's not something I wanted to measure. It's something I wanted to explore. And so phenomenological methodology, hermeneutics, interviews at taping lived experience and reflecting back on it, I felt I was able to sit in the gray area with this methodology, and not try and find answers, but just come up with more questions. And that really drove the research forward. I do feel when we try and express our voice or patients' voices or caregivers voices, there's always going to be layers, because human beings are layered. And when it comes to music, we have such complex associations that have such deep layers to them and deep roots that we don't always even have access to.

Folks often think that I am purely entertainment. There is an entertainment element to having live music that is important. But in fact, the most important thing is that psychotherapeutic relationship that I have with patients. So at the end of the day, it does not become performative, or entertainment. It's all about the therapeutic relationship and the goals we set out such as anxiety management, mood management, processing emotions. The music is often not necessarily beautiful, especially if patients want to express something very raw, very real. It's not about music for entertainment sake, it's about music for self expression. But trying to convey that in a healthcare facility where people assume that if you have a musical instrument, you're providing entertainment, that can be a little bit tricky. The fact that music therapy is a psychotherapy. And certainly in my work, not all music therapist practices psychotherapists, but many of us do, and we're part of the College of Psychotherapists of Ontario. That's often a surprise to other health care professionals. I find that once professionals refer me to their patients, and they see what happens in a music therapy session, or they hear about it from patients, they tend to have a broader understanding of the role of music, and that goes beyond performative, entertaining, or purely aesthetic. Sometimes the most challenging part of my job is getting in the door with a patient. Because just like clinicians have assumptions, patients also have assumptions, not only about me, but about themselves. Patients are often told they are not musical early in life. And so undoing some of those assumptions that people hold about themselves, can in and of itself be therapeutic, I may get a referral from a physician, but if the patient isn't quite ready to go there, it's very challenging to get anywhere psychotherapeutically. But it's hugely rewarding when we can develop a trust. And sometimes that can happen even faster through music than words alone. And it's hugely rewarding when patients invite me in and offer a glimpse of their life story through the lens of music. It's rich, it's intriguing, it's beautiful. It's messy. It's all of these things that I feel privileged to witness. And I always tell patients they never have to, they can of course, not use music because music can be too painful and too sensitive and too intense for patients to access.

So we have a lot of Applied Health professionals, physical therapists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, that also do our trainings and are able to use the information within their scope of practice. So you don't have to be a music therapist necessarily. We also here at the University of Toronto have an applied music and health program where you can learn to become a neurologic music therapist. And then we also have our Master's of Music and Health Science, where you can really learn to understand more about what's going on in the brain. And underpinnings of why this works. So there are lots of opportunities. Everyone who practices as a neurologic music therapist goes through the official training through the Academy of neurologic music therapy. So students, professionals, all the training happens at the academy. And then there are several levels of advanced training as well that you can do."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "48:18", "text": "Check out our show notes for links to upcoming workshops that are being offered through the University of Toronto."}, {"speaker": "Dr. SarahRose Black", "time": "48:23", "text": "For anyone who's wondering what it is, or whether it's for them, I was unsure for a really long time. And it felt like a huge leap to go back to school and study music therapy. What was hugely helpful was talking to a music therapist. I reached out to a few of the music therapists in Toronto who are now my mentors, and just said, \"can I talk to you? Can I ask you questions? What do you do? Who do you work with? What does it feel like?\" And that really gave me the inspiration and motivation to go for it. And also to know that the sky's the limit with music, as it is with music therapy. If you dream it, you can do it, if you want to work in a certain type of facility, amazing. If you want to do something totally unique and creative, you can. I have a really good friend who worked in the community in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. And I have a really good friend who has worked in indigenous health and really wherever you can dream music therapy should go, I say go for it."}, {"speaker": "Priya Shah", "time": "49:20", "text": "And I would say nurture your relationship with music is a huge aspect. Because if you're going to use yourself as a tool, in a clinical situation in a therapeutic relationship, you've got to really value your own relationship with music and to really trust yourself. So make music you don't improvise, keep on doing that. And then maybe also, if you've never had therapy yourself, I would encourage you to go try therapy or maybe even try a session with a music therapist. I would say both of those things: so nurturing your relationship with music and to go and try a therapy session.

But I also knew talking to other peers and other music therapists in the field that there are many contracts available. So that's kind of what my life has become - a lot of contracts mixed together to create this full time kind of work. And so far, I'm really enjoying that because I love the diversity of my work and all the different people I get to talk to, and meet and work with. And it really continues to challenge me as well to get think of different ways to use music therapeutically. And I'm still learning every day about the potential of music therapy. And I learned through my clients, so they teach me so much. And so that gives me a lot of encouragement and drive to continue learning new ways, again, to use music. I also enjoy learning for my clients. I mean, even just songs, I think that I know so many songs, and so many artists, but I find out every day that there's another artist or another song that I never heard before. And so I'm constantly expanding my repertoire because of that, and that's beautiful. But I also think that a lot of people already use music therapeutically, and maybe don't realize. So my approach is very strengths-based and resource-oriented and music-centered. So I'm looking at how to enhance people's strengths that they already have. And then to use music as a resource in as many ways as possible in their lives. And to see, you know, everyday what can music teach us about ourselves?"}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "51:45", "text": "So where is the field of music therapy headed? Well, to start, Bernice explains that music therapy is currently regulated in three provinces in Canada: Alberta, Ontario, and New Brunswick.

We asked our guests what other future directions they are hoping to see."}, {"speaker": "Priya Shah", "time": "52:08", "text": "I think that a lot of health institutions and even smaller settings and support centers are starting to realize like the value of music and music therapy as a very important part of treatment. So yeah, I do think that's changing. And I think the more that music therapists advocate for music therapy and raise awareness about it, and also the research in the field, which there's been more and more of, I think that will start to change in the bigger picture. And I think more healthcare settings will start to look for and want to implement music therapy as part of their treatment."}, {"speaker": "Dr. SarahRose Black", "time": "52:42", "text": "I would love to see more music therapists working in institutions and making it more of a standard of care. I keep thinking \"standard of healthcare,\" that's the phrase that keeps running through my head, that it's not surprising to see a music therapist in a hospital, that clinicians aren't searching for music resources. If a patient does request something musical, that there is a music therapist on staff, and that training programs are more readily available. I do believe that's the direction we're going in. There's dozens of facilities and institutions in Toronto alone where music therapists are working, and it's only growing. So I'm hopeful that it becomes a standard of health care and that it's part of a standard assessment. I know here at Princess Margaret, we're very lucky, especially with social work that a lot of social workers make it part of their assessment when they first meet patients. \"Do you want to meet the music therapist?\" is one of their questions, which is exciting. I hope to see more of that."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "53:34", "text": "I think that's an excellent place to wrap up today's content. We have one more surprise for you at the end.

Now, of course we know it as SARS. And you know, I really watched it cripple our city. We had an outbreak that went on for about four months. Some of my colleagues got infected with SARS. You know, that had a profound psychological effect on the healthcare workforce. And you know, we had billions of dollars evaporate from the local economy as people stopped traveling to the city. And we were just one of many cities around the world that were in the midst of this outbreak.

As a physician specializing in infectious disease with extensive training in Public Health Dr. Khan was on the front line of this public health emergency."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "4:46", "text": "Going perhaps back to 2002, and to the SARS outbreak, if you could tell us a little bit more about what happened and what were some of the controversies in terms of you know the response to it, and you know, things that we learned that perhaps might have informed BlueDot and might inform response to pandemics going forward?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kamran Khan", "time": "5:06", "text": "Well, if we if we just, you know, kind of compare and contrast a little bit of where we are today and what happened with SARS. So SARS started to circulate, it's believed, in Guangdong province sometime in late 2002. I think a key difference from what we're experiencing today is that the world really didn't have a clue as to what was going on in Guangdong Province until that epidemic started to amplify. It ultimately reached Hong Kong, which of course, is one of the largest airports in the world, and then quickly dispersed to these vast, you know, geographic locations around the world, Toronto being one of them. I think, in terms of the things that what I saw, which was pretty profound was that this virus that nobody had ever seen or heard of before, showed up in our hospitals before we even knew it was a thing. And you know, as an infectious disease specialist who's also trained in public health, you know, if I didn't know this was going on, you know, no one really would know this is going on. This was really directly related to my specialty training and so forth. I think one of the things that I learned is when a healthcare worker gets infected, it can have a profound effect on the broader healthcare workforce. You know, people are passionate about what they do, but they want to feel that they can come to work in an environment that is safe, where they're not going to get infected themselves or, you know, take a disease back home to their family. And so I think as we saw some of our peers in healthcare get infected, that was a pretty profound moment. And you can imagine, if things got bad enough, and healthcare workers thought twice about whether they should come to work, you're really in a very difficult situation if you're trying to control an outbreak. So for me, that was kind of the realization that we need better ways to anticipate infectious disease risk. Not to react. You know, we all know how to, you know, call the fire department. But how do we build better smoke detectors? How do we start thinking about ways that we can prevent these types of things from happening in the first place?"}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "7:19", "text": "So have any maybe policy changes or anything in that vein arisen as a result of the things that happened during the SARS outbreak?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kamran Khan", "time": "7:26", "text": "So at a global level, there's an important treaty. It's called the International Health Regulations that came into effect in 2005 - couple of years after the SARS outbreak ended. And there's a whole bunch of different components in the International Health Regulations, but it's essentially a treaty where I believe it's 196 countries are bound to the treaty. And essentially, one of the key tenants of the International Health Regulations is that countries should be rapidly disclosing information about any unusual types of infectious disease outbreaks or threats that are appearing within their country, such that the international community will get wind of this quickly, and will be able to mobilize a coordinated global response and a timely response. That has been a major change. And, you know, there there are questions currently with the coronavirus outbreak in China, whether or not you know, China has been as forthcoming. What I can say is that in 2002 and 03, we really didn't know what was going on. There was very little information coming out. In this situation, if we look at this, you know, this was first recognized on December 31, and New Year's Eve. And here we are three weeks later, the genome has been sequenced. There's lots of information out there. So certainly there has been more information that's been forthcoming. If we look at it from a Canadian context and ask ourselves like, well, what have we learned and what have we done. You know, the Public Health Agency of Canada exists today; that was formed in part because of some of the events during SARS. But I do think that while there have been advances, I still feel that we are still largely very reactive. We, as I mentioned earlier, will react and respond to an emergency with an enormous amount of energy and enthusiasm. But as soon as the emergency is over, we don't use the time in between outbreaks, I think, the way we need to be doing. So so I think a one of our big challenges is just, you know, our inability to focus on threats that we know are inevitable. I mean, you can ask any expert: will we see another outbreak like SARS or the current one we're seeing? And you only have to look at the last 20 years to see these are now growing in frequency. You know 1999, West Nile virus showed up in North America. In 2003, we had the SARS outbreak. In 2009, we had the H1N1 influenza pandemic. You know, in 2014, we had the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. In 2016, the Zika outbreak, and here we are now with the novel coronavirus. And I've left out several others that are in between. So we know that these threats are inevitable, but we are such reactive creatures and we have such reactive organizations that I think we often are not really investing our time and energy in preparing for the next threat the way that we should be."}, {"speaker": "Zeynep Kahramanoglu", "time": "10:42", "text": "We also spoke to Dr. Ross upshur. He's a family physician and professor at the University of Toronto in the Department of Family and Community Medicine. He's also head of the clinical Public Health Division at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, and Associate Director at the Tanenbaum-Lunenfeld Institute, Adjunct Scientist at the Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences. Oh, I'm not done. He's also director of the Bridgepoint Collaboratory for Research and Innovation. Dr. upshur was also at the front lines during SARS. I asked him what happened."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ross Upshur", "time": "11:10", "text": "Now in 2020, we should be much better off than we were in 2003. So SARS illustrated all of our vulnerabilities: the fact that relationships between public health agencies and the clinical world had kind of frayed and fallen apart. There was not clarity in terms of leadership. There wasn't clarity in terms of how information was supposed to flow. And as a consequence of the 2003 SARS outbreak, which I was part of, I was actually, I was that that time working as an academic family physician in Sunnybrook, but because I was trained in communicable disease epidemiology and outbreak management as a public health resident and did some work in the first part of my career, I was seconded up to York Region to assist their Department of Public Health with the management of the outbreak. Originally, I was supposed to be getting ahead of the virus, trying to figure out where it was going to show up, you know, do a look because my modeling work was in time series methods, which has a bit of forecasting capacity, right? Now, of course, you just give it to the computer and have run a machine learning on the data, but the data was sparse and we're trying to figure out. But the overwhelming need at the time was to assist in the outbreak management. So I became the quarantine... got deputized as a medical officer and assisted in the management of the 10,000 people who are on quarantine. So it was a mess. You know, we were looking for anybody who could count we were looking for epidemiologists who knew communicable disease because they hadn't invested in anybody to do communicable disease epidemiology for decades. All the epidemiologists were cancer epidemiologists. So as a consequence of the failures within SARS, we had you know, the Naylor Commission, the Walker Commission, the Campbell permission, the number of reports actually exceed the shelf space of the collected works of Proust, so a lot of effort went into figuring out what was wrong with the system. It's a consequence of that we now have the Public Health Agency of Canada, Public Health Ontario, we have the new Dalla Lana School of Public Health, and all of this is as a result of SARS."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "13:17", "text": "Before we go any further, it's time for a quick microbiology review. Infectious diseases can be caused by a variety of pathogens, namely harmful bacteria, viruses, and parasites. It is important to note that these are entirely different types of pathogen, meaning that for example, a viral infection is entirely different to a bacterial infection and thus can't be treated in the same way. While we have a fairly broad array of options to treat bacterial infections, a physician's ability to fight off viral and parasitic threats is more limited."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "13:53", "text": "Viruses are small independent packages of genetic information.

The range of hosts can be narrow or broad. Many viruses causing infectious disease in humans originated in wild animals and were carried over to humans through an interaction.

The mode of transmission is important in determining how fast this occurs. Some viruses, such as the 2019 novel coronavirus, as well as the more common influenza virus can spread via respiratory transmission, allowing them to fairly easily affect many people very quickly. Other viruses are transmitted via insects, such as the Zika virus. Others still, such as the Ebola virus require direct contact with bodily fluids, including fecal matter or blood from an infected individual. This is much rarer and it thus limits, or at least slows down, their spread."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "15:18", "text": "We asked Dr. Khan to tell us a bit more about Corona viruses in particular."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kamran Khan", "time": "15:22", "text": "Just taking a step back in terms of what are coronaviruses. You know, these are common viruses that can cause the cold. But there are also certain types of, you know, we sometimes refer to them as novel coronaviruses because they're new in human populations. SARS was one of them, which we believe, you know, made the leap from civet cats over into humans. MERS, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, if you've heard of that, another coronavirus, thought to originate from camels, made the leap over into humans. And this one we don't actually know what the animal is, but it's highly suspected that it has an animal origin because of this link to a animal market where wild animals are consumed. I do think one of the important points is that when we think about the lessons that we've learned, if we go back to the SARS outbreak, there's a bit of deja vu here. You know, we had an animal market with an exposure that crossed over into a human and then spread around the world and, you know, was enormously disruptive. And we are now here 17 years later with an animal market and an exposure and a coronavirus, and it is now spreading from person [to person] around the world. We often spend time talking about, you know, should we be doing more at airports or, you know, what should we be doing, you know, in our hospitals. I think we're often looking at the symptom and we're not really addressing the root cause. And I speak to this issue not from a perspective, moral perspective, but I would say that we have to really consider our interactions with animals and other living systems in our world, because ultimately, these types of viruses are entering, you know, the human population, when we either consume wild animals en mass, when we industrialize agriculture and mass produce livestock - you know, we wind up with things like avian influenza and swine flu that could trigger influenza pandemics - or when we have wildlife ecosystems that are grossly disrupted by our footprint, humans start to come in contact with some of these viruses that are in animal populations and the same kind of effect happens. So we have to really be looking upstream and thinking not just about treating the symptom, but ultimately what is the underlying root cause here. These are not simple problems to tackle, but they are essential that we really ask ourselves the difficult questions. If we don't, we may find ourselves every five to 10 years going through something like this again."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ross Upshur", "time": "18:16", "text": "So influenza, coronavirus, and ebola are all zoonotic infections. All of them have to do with human interactions with animal species, usually animal species that we want to eat. So bushmeat in ebola, wet markets in coronavirus, poultry in, because influenza viruses love chickens. So my my question is, you know what does KFC and influenza have to do with each other? So if you take a look at a graph, and I invite all your listeners and you, when you go home, to find a graph of the growth of the global chicken population. Because we like to deep fried them and wrap them in, you know, chicken nuggets. How many McNuggets does a planet need? So as the, and of course, it's not that these chickens are living in bucolic happy conditions, they're in these massive farms. And that's just like creating a Club Med for influenza virus, right? Influenza viruses love chickens, they love ducks, they love bird species. And when you congregate a lot of chickens - and it's a very rapidly mutating virus, right, one per thousand replications leads to a mutant form of influenza virus - and they spread and replicate through avian species very rapidly. So we are going to see more and more of zoonotic infections. We need to rethink our relationship with animal species. There's a really interesting movement called One Health which is veterinary, you know, animal ecologists and health professionals trying to think about ways in which we can interact with animal species in a more productive, less lethal way. So, since 2003, we've had five major zoonotic outbreaks. They're going to keep coming. And if we get all head up and bent out of shape every time it happens, then you start to ask, well, maybe we just like being head up and bent out of shape rather than responding in a concerted rational way and taking preventive measures so that we see less of these in the future."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "20:23", "text": "An individual with 2019 novel coronavirus is likely to have symptoms such as a runny nose, headache, cough, sore throat, fever, and a general feeling of being unwell.

The medical officers - they're medical officers, because public health officials, particularly have policing powers, because their primary role in an outbreak is protection of the community. Whereas the physician has the obligation to care for the particular patient and the well being of the patient, the patient of the health unit and of public health is the entire community. So health protection is one of the really important roles that public health plays, and because outbreaks of infectious diseases that have you know, significant morbidity and mortality, they have to take all steps possible to prevent unnecessary, needless transmission that puts people at risk. That's why they have in every country of the world, they have these powers to bring threats to the community under control by whatever means necessary. Now, that raises huge ethical issues. So quarantine in and of itself, is a major ethical issue because in a liberal democracy, people are used to their, taken for granted, mobility rights. They're enshrined in Canada in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. But all freedoms can be overridden by, you know, weighty considerations."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "27:05", "text": "You've probably heard about the quarantines being imposed on millions of people in China. Cities are being shut down in an effort to stop the spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus. The National Post recently published an article which said that enforcing quarantine Canada would be quote, inconceivable. But is that really true?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ross Upshur", "time": "27:24", "text": "Well, we had, the people are forgetting that in 2003, we had I can't remember off top my head, over 10,000 people in quarantine. But the difference was, we didn't just wake up one morning and say, you know, everybody's in quarantine, there was a certain amount of public engagement, a certain amount of communication. We were very fortunate in the SARS outbreak to have Sheela Basrur -- who the Basrur Center is named after; I actually worked her when I was a resident -- who was probably the most preternaturally gifted risk communicator I've ever known she could just stand up and front of a camera in front of the public and communicate honestly. And she was very well trusted. So that trusting relationship when we we actually did a study on Canadian attitudes and published towards quarantine why Canadians were more when I presented likely to adhere to it. I think there was only 20 or 30 cases of people actually violating their quarantine. And when I presented the data in the United States, they said that'd never happened here, good luck with that! But you know, the certain public spiritedness. Mass quarantine is a blunt instrument. I think it's being used more for its symbolic effect in this context then for its actual effectiveness, because once there are cases outside of the area that's quarantined, cats out of the bag. And so I think there was a report today that there is a case in Chicago so unless you can stop the transmission chains immediately. You're soon get into secondary, tertiary quaternary levels of transmission, and then you lose, so the worst case scenario is you lose that link through contact tracing. And then you've got, you know, uncontained spread in communities. So, but that's hard to do anyway. So quarantine is not necessarily going to achieve it's end. I'm not sure what they were thinking and how they were going to evaluate the impact of this, or whether they were even concerned about that. It backfires sometimes. So for example, in the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, president of Liberia [Ellen Johnson Sirleaf]. There's a little neighborhood in Monrovia that's on a peninsula and there was quite a lot of Ebola transmission there because it's a peninsula. They ran razor wire across the entrance to it. And of course, the population took issue with that and started to resist and unfortunately, somebody was shot and killed. So humans will resist to their mobility being restricted without there being a clear communication on its necessity, without a clear communication on how long they're supposed to do that, and as our research on the ethics of quarantine says, without some reciprocity, right? And that is, there is an obligation on those proposing the quarantine to make it easy for those being quarantined to discharge their obligations. And we learned a lot about that in SARS. So you tell somebody, they can't go out for 10 days, well, they can't lose their job because of that, right? So the workplaces need to know that. What if they need, how are they going to get food? How are they going to get medication, if they need to take medication? What if they have medical needs that they have to... so all those things need to be taken carefully through. So if you can meet that reciprocity condition, and that transparency of communication condition, then it might be justified. And so we published an article, and this goes back to evidence. You know, some people will say, what's the evidence of effectiveness of quarantine? Well, there's not a lot of evidence. In fact, my colleague down the hall here Sue Bondy published I think the only study that shows any benefit from quarantine. What quarantine -- so remember to separate out quarantine from isolation -- you isolate people who are symptomatic, you quarantine people who have been exposed but are not yet symptomatic. The theory being that if their quarantined and they developed symptoms, you can get them into care sooner. And that's what the SARS data showed that people who were in quarantine who became cases got care sooner. Right? So that's the that shows that it works, and it should, because, you know, we don't believe in miasma theory, it should stop chains of transmission, right? Because if it's a person to person or droplet, unless it's some weird, airborne, measles on steroids, it's not likely to be something that transmits further on so that so there's the two roles. One is to get people into care sooner if they become symptomatic, and to break transmission chains. So but you know, putting 30 million people under quarantine, I'm not sure how that's actually going to be well might be enforceable in China, because they have a lot less concern for civil liberties and we have here. But that kind of mass quarantine should only be used as a last resort. It's only justified in highly, highly say uncertain risk, but that the the mortality risk might be higher than people think it is. And by, you know, I don't think we would quarantine a city in Canada. So one of the big issues about restriction of mobility is this whole issue of what are the appropriate limits of state power for the control of disease in a liberal democracy?"}, {"speaker": "Zeynep Kahramanoglu", "time": "32:38", "text": "How would we respond to an outbreak here in Ontario? What kind of systematic responses would be put in place?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ross Upshur", "time": "32:43", "text": "Health is a provincial responsibility. So the way, it's a bit complex because in Ontario, for example, public health is a municipal responsibility. There is a provincial Chief Medical Officer of Health but there are 34 Our health units with Medical Officers that are responsible for communicable disease surveillance, reportable diseases go to the that, and they do the contact tracing and follow up. So what is really important and particularly in light of this new coronavirus is how municipal public health, provincial public health, federal public health and global public health authorities communicate and share information, and then how all of those messages are then connected to the clinical sector. So you start you make a line list of the cases, you make a line list of the contacts. All the contacts need to be contacted, they need to be informed, they need to be told if that if they become symptomatic that they're to report to a hospital or to a health clinic and to make sure that people know that thy're a contact of somebody that was exposed. So there's a lot of work that needs to be coordinated. All the work isn't just within the walls of a hospital. It's an entire system response. So, hopefully -- he says crossing both fingers and knocking on any wooden surfaces nearby -- we are much better prepared now in 2020 for this new coronavirus than we were in 2003. We got caught out in 2003. And it was with huge consequence, the entire outbreak cost somewhere between 30 and 100 billion. A travel advisory was issued against Toronto. So the other thing that's been an investment and the division I lead is called clinical public health precisely because for things like infectious disease response and management, you can't have the clinical world isolated from the world of public health. Public health is responsible for the investigation and management of outbreaks. And that becomes a very complex undertaking. So somebody might show up in an emergency room sick. It's the job of the clinicians to take care of that patient. But now, the new coronavirus is a reportable disease: mandatory reporting, which means that if there's a suspicion that it's a case this new coronavirus, that clinician needs to report it to the local public health authorities. They then will deploy their epidemiology stuff because one case it's kind of like the old nostrum about Lay's potato chips, you can never eat just one. Viruses never come as one case alone, particularly respiratory viruses, they tend to have onward chains of transmission. And that's the real, the real shoe leather part of putting out an outbreak is following up on contacts. So you need to get people who have been exposed to an index case, you need to find each and every one of them. And if you've been following the outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of Congo, you know how difficult that is, because think if somebody asked you, who have you talked to in the last, or have been in a shared airspace within the last 48 hours."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "35:52", "text": "Dr. upshur also spoke about the role of the who during an outbreak."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ross Upshur", "time": "35:57", "text": "So the World Health Organization is the the global public health organization. I have a lot of sympathy for the WHO I mean, I was for several years the Director of the WHO Collaborating Center in Bioethics, upstairs in the Joint Center for Bioethics, and I still have a role. Jennifer Gibson's, the director but we have a work plan with the WHO, and and I'm kind of the lead for epidemics and ethics. So the World Health Organization, many people think it has more power and resource than it actually has. And its budget has gone down and its revenue sources are largely tied to programs. And that's unfortunate. And, you know, just to contextualize a little bit Ontario spends $65 billion a year on health and healthcare. The budget of the World Health Organization is about $5 billion dollars a year and they're meant to set standards for every kind of disease globally. So it runs on fumes. And it has a lot of responsibility. It has a lot of symbolic authority. But the thing to remember is that the WHO is an organization within the United Nations. So when people talk about global health, they get, you know, I've done a lot of work with Medicine Sans Frontiers, and you know, no borders, you know, Doctors Without Borders, we're not going to admit national borders, WHO can't do that. It's, it relates to its member states. So the idea of a nation state and the sovereignty of the nation state and the capacity of the nation state to decide for itself are the rules within which the World Health Organization has to act. The thing that was a little bit different about the International Health Regulations is that it actually gave a tiny little bit of leverage for the WHO to apply to nation states, particularly if they were not being transparent, about disclosing the extent of an outbreak, but they don't have any sanctioning ability, right? They can only use moral suasion. So a lot of people sort of rolled their eyes for example, in the 2014 when the Ebola outbreak started to ramp up about the WHO not doing enough, and there was pressure to have public health emergency of international concern, which they declared finally in August of 2014. But Margaret Chan said -- and she was the director general at the time -- and said the WHO is a technical organization, we provide advice to member states."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Margaret Chan", "time": "38:41", "text": "Ultimately, health systems with International Health Regulation core capacities must be strengthened in your countries to protect unexplained deaths much earlier.

If they don't come up with funding support, I think we're going back to square one. You want a strong who? Invest in WHO."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ross Upshur", "time": "39:32", "text": "So the member states, the Gates Foundation, provides a lot of money [for] World Health Organization, but sometimes their aid is tied to programs and a lot of the thinking is very vertical, like we'll give WHO you know x hundred million dollars for HIV AIDS, but it can only go to HIV AIDS, and many of the global health ills that plague vast number of people on the planet living with very few means relate to no access to health care at all, and no coverage. Right? So that's why the big campaign is for universal access and universal coverage. So a basic health package for every instantiated human on Earth. And that's what they're trying to push forward. As there's large parts of the world where millions of people have no access to any form of healthcare."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "40:22", "text": "Infectious disease continues to be a major global problem. The frequency and spread of outbreaks will only increase as a result of the changing climate, as both our guests have alluded to. This is an established fact amongst experts. Yet, on a global scale, we seem to continue to grapple with exactly the same issues with each new outbreak and seem rather unprepared for what's to come. We need novel and better approaches, including better warning systems to slow or even stop infectious disease outbreaks in their tracks. I asked Dr. Khan about the work his company BlueDot is doing to create such a system."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kamran Khan", "time": "40:58", "text": "So BlueDot, we are digital health company. We're just over 40 people. We are an eclectic mix of physicians and veterinarians and ecologists and data scientists and software developers, designers. We're a pretty diverse group. And our, you know, main goal is to build early warning systems for emerging infectious disease threats like the pandemic threat that we are seeing. BlueDot was founded in 2013. I spent the next 10 years or so in my role as an academic and a scientist at St. Michael's Hospital and at the University of Toronto, studying global outbreaks. Eventually, I reached a point where I realized that we had to be able to generate and move knowledge faster than the disease's move themselves. And while the academic arena was really an is a great space for discovery, it is not necessarily the most agile in terms of communication of that discovery. If you've ever submitted publication for a peer review, you know that that could take you months to years, whereas with an outbreak, you have to be operating in hours to days. And so it's just the wrong vehicle. So I took a bit of a leap of faith, I am not an entrepreneur or a person with a background in business. Took a bit of a leap of faith, MaRS innovation and the MaRS Discovery District kind of helped me get started to think about this. Founded BlueDot in 2013, it was just me at the time. And here we are six years later with, you know, over 40 of us and building some really kind of cutting edge tools that we are excited about because they are ultimately about ways that we can make the world a safer and more secure and a better place."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "42:46", "text": "Sort of expanding on that -- on the idea of doing better.

How can we better address this issue?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kamran Khan", "time": "42:58", "text": "You know, going back again to the outbreak in 2003. It was clear to me that there were a number of things we needed to do. One was to be able to recognize that there were outbreaks earlier. The second was we needed to be able to anticipate how they spread. And I think the final one was, we'd have to be able to generate and disseminate knowledge faster than the diseases can move themselves. So let me start with the first you know, on one hand, we're in an interesting period in human history where we have this confluence of different global forces that are driving the emergence and spread of infectious diseases. So population growth, you know, seven and a half billion people in the planet, urbanization, more than 50% of the world's population living in cities, climate change, commercial air travel. So these are all key drivers of emergence and spread. But we're also in this interesting period where there are novel data streams that we can make use of the where there are advanced analytical techniques like machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence to be able to make sense of vast amounts of data. And then we have digital technologies like smartphones and other kind of supercomputers that we carry around with us, where we can literally send knowledge around the world instantaneously. I know just for context, I think I had my first blackberry or so back in 2002. So you can kind of get a sense, a lot has changed. So I think the question and really the challenge for us at BlueDot has been, can we generate and spread knowledge faster than the diseases spread themselves? So I'm going to talk a little bit about sort of three pillars to what we are calling a global early warning system for infectious diseases that we've been building. Now I recognize that's a pretty bold statement, but we also sort of feel that we need to be taking some pretty bold steps in order to utilize the data and analytical and technological tools that we have available to us, they're being utilized in other areas in marketing and communication and advertising. You know, why aren't we using the same kinds of tools to be doing something that can have a much broader social impact around the world. And so in many ways, that's kind of the inspiration for all of us at BlueDot. Kind of what gets us out of bed in the morning and into work is the feeling that we can be doing something that's much bigger than ourselves. So I'll tell you a little bit about the three pillars of this early warning system. One of the first is to be able to detect threats more rapidly. So as you can imagine, after SARS, there was a recognition that if we wait for governments to officially report information, we may not always get it in a timely manner. Having said that, the International Health Regulations has come in still and then since so, you know, there a mechanism and an incentive for countries to disclose. But still, that information may not be timely. Well, increasingly, the internet has become a medium for surveillance for being able to detect or become aware of infectious disease threats around the world. But of course, the internet is this incredibly vast medium, with information in so many different languages, and so forth. So, our team of engineers and data scientists and clinicians have built a engine that uses natural language processing and machine learning to read through over 100,000 articles every single day in 65 languages currently looking for over 100 different infectious diseases. And it does this every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. So the natural language processing engine can distinguish how if the article is really about an infectious disease threat, or you know, maybe the word plague, for example, is used in some other contexts, it doesn't have anything to do with an outbreak. But by training this engine, it's actually been able to classify this information and say, okay, that's something you need to pay attention to. This is actually irrelevant, don't worry about it. So in a sense, it's kind of finding the metaphorical kind of needles in the haystack for us. Because as you could, as you can imagine, if you had to manually do that, and read in 65 languages, you'd need a team of a few hundred people working around the clock. So we have four clinicians who can supervise this entire system and all of a sudden now we have the ability to scan events and threats that are appearing around the world incredibly quickly. To put that in context with this novel, coronavirus outbreak, we actually picked this up through our system on December 31 on New Year's Eve, and had already reported on it to all of our clients before 10am on December 31. That was roughly a week before other national and international organizations had really spoken to this event. So that's a little bit about how we are collecting information from official sources, but also using these other information sources to gather epidemic intelligence quickly, to be able to geo-locate and timestamp and contextualize all of this information, organize it and structure it. The second part is to assess what the risks are. So if something is appearing, and Wuhan and I'm sitting here in Toronto, do I need to be worried if there are 11 cases there? Is that something that I should think about? Or what if it was 111? And how does this disease move? So we often say that people should think global and act local, but this is one of those situations that's really difficult. We know that for certain diseases for many diseases, humans ultimately become the vectors that spread the disease from one geographic area to the next. So in order to understand how a disease might spread. We have to understand how people move. So as an academic going back, you know, more than a decade, I've been studying the global airline transportation network, using data on ticket sales, billions of pieces of data on ticket sales, to understand how, again in an anonymized fashion, how billions of people are moving through this global network. And ultimately, that is the same mechanism through which infectious diseases can move. There's been about a decade of research into testing and validating the mathematical and epidemiological methods to determine if this works. And it turns out that perhaps not surprisingly, where people go, infectious diseases affecting people will also follow. If we actually look at the current outbreak. I believe of the leading six international destinations out of Wuhan, five of the top six now have confirmed cases of this coronavirus and below that, you know, the vast majority of them do not. So, so this is the second kind of pillar is incorporating information on how humans move around the world. And then there's lots of other contextual data that we've been incorporating. Even things like real time satellite data, that would allow us to understand things like temperature, precipitation, humidity. For many diseases, if a disease is introduced into a geographic area, it may not have the right environmental conditions to actually trigger another outbreak. You know, you wouldn't expect to have a mosquito borne disease spread at this time of year in January in Toronto. And the same can be true for many other diseases around the world. So that's kind of the second pillar, and the last pillar really is just building the technological tools to be able to disseminate this knowledge to audiences around the world and largely today at BlueDot, we are supporting government agencies in Asia and North America and in other parts of the world. We are also building systems to generate intelligence to support hospitals and frontline healthcare workers, because patients who are sick are going to wind up in the emergency department. And we need and we rely on our frontline health care workers to be able to recognize the disease they may have never seen before. And we also support certain types of businesses like airlines that are traveling around the world and need to be aware of what types of threats may be appearing."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "51:37", "text": "The information being generated by groups such as BlueDot is vital to facing up to the challenge of infectious disease, the policy changes need to be made in order to implement this information."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ross Upshur", "time": "51:45", "text": "So in terms of policy changes, probably the most important and significant, but even now it's starting to show its limitations... So SARS was under the old quarantine regulations and in 2005, the World Health Organization passed what are called the International Health Regulations. So anybody who's interested in global health needs to understand what the World Health Organization is, what its powers and the limitations are, and what the International Health Regulations are. And they're binding on all of the member states. And they're the ones that, so they talk about the obligation to share information, the obligation to bring things to the attention of Geneva. And it's within the International Health Regulations that this thing called a \"public health emergency of international concern\" is defined. And it's like the world believes that once you declare something a public health emergency of international concern, all of a sudden the you know, the WHO is on steroids, and it's got this muscle that it can do all this stuff. It has no such thing. And it's a binary decision. And that's the unfortunate thing. So a good example was the H1N1 pandemic. So there was a lot of concern that we needed some sort of mechanism that was more graded. So that you would like tie severity into it rather than just yes or no. And I noticed that in the report that came out of the World Health Organization, there is some discussion about changing the policy to sort of have it more of a spectrum, rather than either or. So the International Health Regulations are the big policy change in global health. Nationally, as I mentioned, we have the Public Health Agency of Canada, which we have a very good public health lab based in Winnipeg, that's where our level 4 and we sort of got level 4 containment facilities. Actually a lot of the research that led to the now drugs and vaccines that have been evaluated and found to be useful in the DRC [ebola] outbreak came out of that lab. There's an interesting history to that, but how Canada got involved in Ebola research when it's not really a place where you're ever going to run into Ebola presumably. So there's been so those would be the major policy changes the global policy on the public health: International Health Regulations and in Canada having a independent Public Health Agency of Canada with Chief Public Health Officer, the investment in public health training. And we still you know, that being said, I think there's a lot more work that can be done to bring about closer integration and better public understanding."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "54:18", "text": "Dr. Khan elaborated on different aspects of mitigating outbreak risk and what steps can be taken."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Kamran Khan", "time": "54:23", "text": "I think ultimately, when we talk about prevention or mitigation of risk, there's really three frontiers where you can do things one is at the source itself.

The second frontier is how people move from one geographic location to the next. So you often hear about well, you know, should we be putting up thermal scanners or doing things in our airports. So when we There is what's called exit screening, which is, travelers as they're leaving, they have to make what's called the travelers health declaration about, you know, have they been to the market? are they feeling sick, and so on and so forth. I believe they're also doing some kind of the infrared thermography and temperature testing. And, you know, that intervention, I think it makes sense to not have someone who's sick board a plane and then you know, go somewhere else in the world. The more controversial area is, whether or not you should be doing entry screening when people arrive into your country. And it's controversial for a couple of reasons. One is we had experience doing this during SARS, where we screen millions of travelers and we actually did not find any cases of SARS. Now, why is that? And I want to explain this in the context of the current outbreak in Wuhan. The first thing is in Canada, there are no direct flights coming from Wuhan. So as you can imagine, you can't go to one part of the airport and say okay, like we're gonna just make sure as everyone gets off the plane, we're going to assess them, because they're coming from everywhere, from Frankfurt and Singapore and Tokyo and London and every place you can imagine they're making these connections before their last leg into Canada. So logistically, it's very challenging to think about, well, how would you do this? The second key piece relates to something called the incubation period, which is the time between a person getting exposed to a particular disease and a time that they actually develop symptoms. Now for coronaviruses, and we don't know the incubation period for sure for this particular coronavirus, but generally, for things like SARS and MERS, they've been in the order of five or six days on average, but can be as long as two weeks. So you can imagine that a person who's been exposed can get on a plane, you might have to wait 14 days before they get sick. So you can just think of how many times you could go around the Earth in 14 days. It'd be probably close to 14. And the more likely scenario is that if a person has been screened before they get on the plane, and they don't seem to have a fever or are sick at that time, is the far more likely scenario is that if they do get sick and they are infected, they will get sick well, after they've left the airport, if you use an infrared scanner, and and try and assess their temperature, they won't have a fever. If you ask them about symptoms, they'll feel fine, even if they're carrying the virus has not reached a point where they actually have any symptoms. So this is where you know the discussions around we need to be educating travelers when they arrive, about what this disease is, what are the manifestations, if they develop an illness, what should they do, so that we can quickly identify cases and make sure the appropriate management is is taking place. So that's kind of the second frontier beyond the origin as people are traveling. And then the third is really what are we doing in our local communities to be anticipating and preparing for this because one case could remain one case if we detect it quickly, we isolate the patient, and so on. Or one case could become 10 cases or 100 cases or thousand cases, maybe if we don't. So, this is where we need to be really engaging, and our frontline health care workers become so important. But it's a really difficult task for them, as you can imagine. Healthcare workers, you know, if you've gone into a hospital, emergency department, or maybe even your primary care provider, you know, just how busy these places are. And as a frontline healthcare worker, I can say myself, it is very easy to get overwhelmed by the volumes that you are having to manage. So we are so distracted, we don't really have time to be thinking about some disease or some outbreak appearing halfway around the world. That's the last thing on our mind. But in today's world, that disease might find its way into our emergency room in a matter of hours. So how do we not overwhelm the healthcare workers, but deliver insights that are meaningful to them just when they need them? And this is a lot of the work that we've been doing at BlueDot, is surveilling infectious disease threats around the world, connecting it to the entire world's air travel data. So that if I'm in here in Toronto, and there's an outbreak 10,000 kilometers away from me, this system will know how many cases there are, it will understand what's the population at risk, it will understand how many people are moving to the city that I'm in, and it will send me a very short 60 second blurb on: What is this? How would I recognize it? What's the personal protective equipment I need? Do I need to put the person in isolation? So now, it's front of mind. But we don't want you to know about every single threat in the world. Because if we do that, you quickly are just going to tune out. This is kind of the cry wolf scenario, which is just like I've heard too many alerts, I'm not going to pay attention to any of them. And so this is, I think, where we have a real opportunity with data and analytics and technology to do things that are really, really precise, and just in time, so we can give that individual a global panoramic view, while they're just standing where they are, and they're distracted and have very limited time. And so this is one of the real challenges of what we're doing at BlueDot but I think one of the really exciting opportunities about how we will deliver health care in a world where we can no longer just think about what's in our backyard, the whole world is now our backyard."}, {"speaker": "Zeynep Kahramanoglu", "time": "1:00:55", "text": "There are obviously many limitations and trying to control the spread of a disease. Dr. Upshur mentioned one that is often overlooked."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Ross Upshur", "time": "1:01:02", "text": "Political will. Right? So people, you know, we would like to think that governments care about their people, but there are many governments that really don't care about their citizens and their population. We're very fortunate in Canada, where we're democratically enabled and we have resources to actually provide people with basic health care, and that's publicly funded, you know. Everybody has access to insured medical care. That's the exception, not the rule, even south of the border, 40 million people, no coverage, right? And so what happens then is that people face economic ruin, to manage treatable health conditions. And that was the decision you know that Tommy Douglas would often argue when he was arguing for a publicly funded health care system that in a you I think, paraphrasing in a civilized society, no one should go bankrupt for a treatable disease. And so that's something we should work and aspire to. And the WHO is, you know, that's what they would like to do. But you need the public, you need the political will, If we diverted just a small percentage of the money that we spent spent on arms, we could afford health care around the world. It's doable. It's just you've got to, you know, you've got to want to have healthy people as much as you want surface to air missiles. So some people would say, you know, you're spending all this money, yes, you know, yeah, people die viruses all the time. What about the opioids? What about this? What about that? How do you think about fair allocation of resources? Certain very severe outbreaks can cause some very difficult resource allocation decisions. For example, we did a lot of work around intensive care beds and ventilated beds, particularly when you're thinking about pandemic influenza where there's a high rate of pneumonia and respiratory disease, and there's only so many ventilated beds. How do you go about deciding who gets access to a ventilated bed? So we did a lot of work on that. Then there's all of these issues around global governance and global coordination. And these come up, you know, you look at Ebola. Duty to care? Check. Isolation, quarantine? Check. Resource allocation? A lot of complaints, like you know, Ebola like yeah, Ebola is not the only disease. More people are dying of malaria. And by the way, in West Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo, if all the work is going into and all the resources are going into Ebola, and they're not going into supporting maternal child programs, or you know, accompanied births, and so you have little spikes of mortality from other diseases, because all the resources are going here.

And unfortunately, misinformation travels very quickly. And it's hard enough to put out and to stop and control an outbreak with the finite resources that we have. And these are dedicated professionals who know what they're doing. But if you're starting to spend a lot of time tracking down rumors or people who are offering fake cures and things like that, it just makes the job that much more difficult.

And one of them is: we really have to give more thought and attention and action toward how we are interacting with other living systems on our planet. The rules of nature apply to us. Nature is trying to tell us something. This is the second time now we're hearing the same story. We need to pay attention and not just thinking of whether we can put better scanners in airports. But we need to really confront the root cause of this issue. I think the second thing is: we are in an incredible era with data and analytics and technology and our ability to generate insights is, you know, really unprecedented and I think it will only become even more powerful with time. We have to be able to move information more quickly. That is going to be our competitive advantage because these diseases move incredibly quickly and fast. We are just going to have to move faster. And lastly, I guess I would just say that we are by nature, very reactive creatures and beings. What's going to be essential is for us to stay focused on what is needed even when the emergency is not in front of us. We're going to need to maintain the same level of rigor and while we are in between outbreaks as we are when the emergency actually happens. I know that's a very tall order. It requires, you know, a tremendous amount of leadership to say, we should be focusing on a threat when we've got other things, you know, right in front of us that we need to deal with.

On this week's episode, we explore what our future could look like if we start to modulate our own biology at the genetic level. Dr. Josiah Zayner, CEO of the ODIN and promoter of DIY biology, shared his passion for hands-on science, learning from self-experimentation and genetic engineering in his own home. The techniques and the potential of genetic engineering were further explained by Andrew Hessel, a \"genomic futurist\" and co-lead of the Genome Project-Write. We also spoke with Dr. Michael Szego, Clinical Ethicist and Assistant Professor, Department of Family and Community Medicine and Molecular Genetics at the University of Toronto, to weigh in on the role of ethics in genetic engineering.

And, this is a huge issue in China; I think 0.1% of the population has HIV or is living with HIV. And, so this is this was clearly a huge issue. But, what people are essentially saying is this was the wrong gene to target. So, we don't know what sort of off targets these kids have. We don't know if they're actually HIV resistant, which is kind of sad, because that was the whole idea of the experiment.

There's no, like, documents or guides online that teach you how to do certain things, which is crazy, right? If you want to do certain experiments, hands-on experiments, let's say with animals or with, you know, cells and cell culture, mammalian or human cell culture, like, there's not a lot of description on how to do these things, not a lot of guides and information about the actual hands-on aspect of it. And, that's crazy that it is all just stuck in this environment, you know, academia and big industry. And, I think that, like, giving that knowledge to people can only be beneficial, because with it, if this technology is sufficiently powerful like everybody says, if it can do all the things that scientists believe it can do, then these people who have access to it will also be able to do those things, right? What if the scientific population of the world, like, doubled or tripled or 10X? That'd be a bad thing? You know, I just can't see it that way.

And I think those are unfair goals or, or things like that, right? I think those are unfair things, standards to set these people to when, like, just a few years ago, there was nothing, absolutely nothing, right? People could do absolutely nothing, like yeah, sure, you might be able to find some materials here and there and put some stuff together, but there was no way to learn this stuff. Pretty much if you didn't, you didn't know what you were doing. And now, you know we have classes teaching people how to do human cell culture at home without CO2 incubators without anything, and people are successful at it, right? There are so many people that we've worked with, who, in the US, don't, don't even have, like, high school diplomas. And across the world, we've sent out kits to Nepal, Sudan, Ethiopia for free donating the supplies to people. I don't know what they're going to do, what's going to happen in the future in years time; maybe people don't create anything, maybe they just get educated and learn. But like, that would be the greatest thing ever. If society all knew what DNA was, knew what genetic engineering was, knew how to do all these things, like, I think that's a big win on its own, the biggest one, because it's just like, people, you know, we get so many messages like, \"Oh my gosh, I didn't think I'd ever be able to like learn how to do this or experienced this in my lifetime, and this is like so cool that I could learn how to do genetic engineering,\" and it's just like, that's awesome and amazing."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "15:44", "text": "While much of Josiah's motivation lies in empowering and educating the public, we had to wonder.

That, I think, is up to each person, and it's up to their own self-expression. It's body autonomy to me. I mean, what about parents who get IVF and, you know, have a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis to, like, choose whether their child has, has a disease or not? You know, like, where do we draw the line on this? To some people, it's after genetic diagnosis and before gene editing.

They certainly weren't really at risk for HIV to begin with. So, it's not like you're protecting them. You're not intervening in sort of an unmet medical need.

So, what would your response be to that?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Josiah Zayner", "time": "23:24", "text": "Maybe, but like, tetanus isn't an unmet medical need, right? We get tetanus vaccines. Tetanus is not a communicable disease. It's caused by a bacteria that can be treated with antibiotics. Before the tetanus vaccine came out in the US, there was around 580 people a year who got tetanus. 580 people a year who got tetanus, and it can be treated with an antibiotic. I'm not saying government forced to get a tetanus vaccine, but, you know, we pretty much are, you know, something like that. Yeah, yeah. There's like something like 90% coverage in the US. There's no heard immunity or anything like that with tetanus. Our chances of getting tetanus nowadays, it's a soil bacteria, are like practically insignificant and can be treated with antibiotics. So it's like, according to the CDC, there's about a one in 100,000 chance you'll receive some type of neuropathy from the tetanus vaccine. Is that a, a risk that we're willing to take with our children, with ourselves, with anybody? We say yes, right? To me, it's like, what's the difference between the HIV thing, if we considered it a vaccine, right? About 0.1% of the Chinese population has HIV. That's, that's pretty significant. That's, that's around 1.5 million people, right? 1.5 million. So you know, like, who knows. Sure, like, HIV is not a scary thing, and we should not, you know, stigmatize it at all. There are plenty of ways to prevent HIV without gene editing or anything like that, just as there's plenty of ways to prevent tetanus. But like, if you look at it like that, I don't get the difference. To me, it comes down mostly to an ethical argument, the whole gene edited babies thing. Not really a, you know, like risking lives or anything, risking children or making decisions for children. It's more of, like, an ethical argument.

And we don't necessarily know the context in which informed consent was given or, like, how much knowledge the parents would have had on, on HIV, and, like, the specific gene that was mutated and what the specific mutation was.

We are approaching it from the standpoint that, like, all the effects from this will just be strictly negative. And, you know, I don't know, you know, don't, don't put me in and say like, \"I'm going to argue that they're all going to be positive,\" or you know, that things positive will come up. But, what if we approached it from the point of view of that, like, it is positive that like one of these babies was treated, has no side effects, and they're resistant to HIV. Then what? Again, then, it just becomes, comes down to an ethical argument, right? Or, you know, trying to figure out if consent was given properly or something like that. And, that's where bugs me, because, like, the only thing, I think, between viewing this in a positive or negative light is just if you think the results will be positive or negative.

But, I want to be clear. If the scientists had, had used CRISPR not to do an enhancement to make HIV resistant babies, but instead, he had worked with infertile couples to bring a baby into the world that wouldn't otherwise have been born, it would have been the IVF, you know, the modern version of IVF. That was the, that was such an obvious mistake in the choice of the project that I can only think he was just poorly advised, because I would have told him that, in two minutes, \"hey, if you're going to go in and try and push the envelope, go and do something where there is a moral force behind.\" You're bringing a person into the world that wouldn't, didn't have a chance to be born. You're helping parents who, you know, the most powerful thing you can do in life is, is have children, and you're helping them.

So, that's changed the lives of so many people."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Hessel", "time": "30:04", "text": "I have two kids that that are, you know, born from IVF, so, like, I have great respect for the technology. But, the, you know, that, so that was a waste. I also agree with Josiah's essay that it's a waste to put the scientist in jail even as flawed as his work was. He did humanity a service by taking what had been a theoretical discussion and making it very pragmatic, and now people are thinking about, well, how do you do this in a safe and responsible and transparent way with proper regulatory oversight? And, and I think that's done humanity a service. We won't figure all this out; there will always be edge cases, there will be, there will be other problems. But right now, CRISPR is an amazingly powerful tool for helping people, and, and I believe that over the next decade, as we start to move into whole genome engineering, we're only going to be able to do this type of modification or design of completely new things at a faster and faster pace more accurately, more robust. So, again, it will offend some people just because they think we're playing God, but in my view, it is just another technology that humanity has to, you know, to master. And, it's the only technology that, that is provably sustainable and compatible with life. So, I think it's, I really believe that bio-technologies, in general, help us find a or create a new balance with nature that, you know, that really makes, starts to repair some of the damage that we've done with early, with earlier technologies.

Turn the volume down on people that are, are negative, and, and see, you know, and kind of work with the positive. And, I'm not too worried about... Like, accidents can happen. I get it, you know, like that, I like to say, look, the, in terms of existential risk, we still got tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. I don't really worry about life all that much. You know, I think that's the threat. I think, in terms of causing harm to others, you can do it with computers, you know, much easier than you do with biology today. So, I think we've got a window here, you know, to kind of get, you know, get up to speed. And, I think there will be some sort of sensitizing events at some point where someone will use these technologies in a way, either nefariously or by accident, to do something that sensitizes the world that we have to start thinking about things. And it's not, it's not gene editing things; that's not going to change the world. I think, I think it's going to be something, can be some other biological, perhaps with a virus. I don't know. But, but I want us to start thinking and preparing for something like that, because it's pretty predictable. It's going to happen. When we, when we started networking computers, the scientists didn't even really think about, \"oh, we need kind of an immune system for computer networks,\" but then, there was a sensitizing incident with the Morris worm, and if you don't know what that is, go and Google it and read about it, but, that was kind of a error that set off a chain of events that ultimately crippled the nation's internet, and, it was an honest mistake. And, and that kind of seeded more and more awareness that, yeah, we kind of have to have, you know, if you have a, you need a digital immune system and then antivirus software, blah, blah, blah, you know, start rising. So I think, I think there's an opportunity to completely rethink biological security and create a whole new ecosystem and industry that is a lot better. And I think it turns into what we would recognize today as just better public health, and public and healthcare, and environmental stewardship. That's what it would look like if you built that type of system. I think, in general, it's not so much an ethical issue. I think it's how do we get everyone in the world more comfortable with these technologies just as they've become more comfortable with computer technologies, and cell technologies, and AI, and robots, and whatever else.

Where do you think we are in terms of that, because I've heard you speak previously on how the rate of this, that, this technology is advancing really fast.

A relatively new area of science that uses the principles of engineering to design new or redesign existing biological systems. Most of you probably know about the successes of the Human Genome Project, a multi billion dollar initiative to sequence the first human genome. The Human Genome Project was completed nearly 20 years ago, and now, we've dramatically improved technologies to read DNA faster at a much lower cost, from several billion dollars to now just a couple hundred dollars per genome. More amazingly, we can not only read our DNA, we can edit it using tools like CRISPR. And now, we can actually write the code of life, too, using synthetic biology. Andrew explains how we can write code using all the A's, T's, C's, and G's, compile it, turn a digital DNA into physical DNA, and load that code into cells or cell free systems to see if it's running properly. We can then go through iterations of debugging until we reach our biological design goals."}, {"speaker": "Andrew Hessel", "time": "37:57", "text": "I want to be able to robustly design and build a biological system. And, whether it's a single protein, or a nucleic acid string, or a virus, or a cell, or an organism, or a tissue, it doesn't matter. I'm kind of application agnostic. But, I'd like to be able to go and bio-engineer. And, here's what I know from working in other areas of engineering. It requires tools. And, that means, for me, it all starts with the software tools to make the design. And now, and you can go a little upstream from that where you can say, well, you have to have a design intention. I want to build a bridge, I want to make a cell do this, whatever. But, you, but then, you need a tool set. A building is easy compared to a cell. So I want CAD software for cells. I want, I want it to be like Google Earth but for a cell. I want it to be that powerful. I want to be able to design code for that cell simulator and have a pretty good idea of how it's going to run in that model cell before I ever go and build it. But to get there, we're going to have to do a few iterations between genotype and phenotype at the cellular level to really train that system, because bio physics compared to the physics you would do for a building or car, like biophysics is magic. Like, how and, how a single protein folds or an enzyme works can be mind boggling. So, I know we have to go and do a little bit of, you know, more work on the model, but, but that process of sitting down at software designing, compiling your code DNA synthesis, getting it into a cell or cell-free system, and doing the test and measurement, I want to see that entire process as be completely digital and no lab tools required for any, for, so I want my daughter who's like five to be able to go up, and I want to be able to teach her own software very easily to be able to make a bacterium glow. But, I don't think she needs to actually handle that bacterium to do it. So, all of the backend, you know, DNA synthesis, and boot up, and testing, I want to see on an automated platform. Josiah is much more hands-on and wants to teach people the experience of doing lab work and get them, you know, feeling, and tasting, and, and really building a community around it. And, and that's hard, because you need a place to do it. You need the reagents and supplies, which is his business. He's doing pretty well with that. But, you also have to train, and you have to engage. He's just got a very different way of dealing with, with his community and supporting his community. He's done a great job. But, I want to see, I want to see that community grow even faster and in a more synchronized way. And, I think that's done through a digital platform. Another thing that I absolutely think is going to happen is we're going to have more biological engineers, whether they are 10 year olds, they're learning how to start coding, you know, bacterial metabolism to, to just the diversity of various professionals coming into the world, very much like software engineer. I think we're going to have, you know, biological engineers like that. And, more of those biological engineers, then we have PhD scientists in, you know, in the next five to 10 years. I think this community is just going to explode, and not everyone is going to go and try and cure cancer or completely reprogram, you know, E. coli, but, to me, the outputs of a lot of bioengineers being empowered with a digital system, ultimately, you end up getting something like a biological App Store. If you go into the App Store, there are, there are so many apps that, you know, you don't even know where to start. But, you know, they, it's kind of a, it's kind of a primordial soup of software. And the best stuff kind of, you know, people find out about it, and they start to use it. I think something like that is going to happen in, in biological engineering. And, it will be bottom-up with people that may not have a lot of training, just someone comes along and says \"oh,\" and they can look through past projects that iGem where they can take a course with Josiah or they can just have an idea that they want to try. And, if they can write a little bit of biological code with the right software tool, and it's going to get easier and easier to do this type of work with better software. And, if, if compiling that genetic code is inexpensive. Again, I tell people today, \"look, if you have to pay 10 cents a base pair, like you do it many DNA synthesis places like 10 cents a bit. If you pay 10 cents a character every time you type, no one would tweet, because it would be 14 bucks.\" Right? So that's kind of the limiting step in playing with synthetic biology. It's not the software tool, it's access to synthesis at, you know, at a playful price. So, because, you know, so you write a gene of 1000 base pairs to code, you know, it's still going to cost you 100 bucks to boot up that gene. Right? So that's okay. There's ways to do it cheaper if you have... But, but still, that's just, that's a lot. And then, if you actually, that doesn't get you the results of running that code in a cell yet, so then, you have more overheads. But, when all of that is integrated, and it might cost $1, then suddenly people get to play, and particularly if that, if that system doesn't involve you doing those manipulations in your garage or your bedroom or your kitchen at home, now it's being done in a robotic laboratory that is essentially properly equipped for dealing with, you know, living organism, potentially infectious and living organisms, now you can really start to get the creative juices going.

And, and you might, you know, for example, you might be completely against GMOs, but, if you were starving you, you would shift your opinion, you would soften a little bit. So, you know, you might be really against animal research, but then you might need a drug to treat your cancer that's been tested on animals.

So, those are all sort of some themes that sort of, was sort of percolate up and then trigger an ethics consult, and then, I would get a page and get involved. That's kind of the clinical side.

And, they're not doing it in a regulated environment. They're basically conducting science on themselves in their basement. And, there isn't sort of that, there isn't any oversight. And, one could argue from a libertarian perspective that if they wanted to do that to themselves, you know, that's fine. But, I am so used to a regulated environment where we, again, we try and mitigate risk the best we can. We do things in a very stepwise fashion where, you know, if we're doing a, we're doing a clinical trial, there's always going to be a phase one where we gonna look for what is the kind of the safe dose to give, and that's a very small number of patients, and then, there's the phase two, then there.

So, if it was something relatively innocuous, then I think it really does, it does sort of hinge on what the risk to the individual are and how well informed is that individual about what they're doing. So, it's not that it happens to take place in the person's home and not in a hospital environment that just makes me uncomfortable, because it's very different.

In this case, they were changing one of the receptors to HIV to confer resistance to HIV infection. So, these children would have been born perfectly healthy without CRISPR. They, it was basically just a proof of concept. And so, scientists took perfectly healthy embryos and altered one of the receptors for HIV. And again, you know, we don't know what the off target effects could be. We don't know what the long-term effects would be on the health of these children. So, I think it really was, you know, reckless use of science and, in many ways, could take a good technology and, like, you talked about the event that happened in gene therapy, this could be the same thing with CRISPR where everyone all of a sudden looks this technology remembers what happens in China and says, you know, we shouldn't be doing it, we shouldn't be touching it.

Because, sort of the way I like to describe it is, weather is what you get, whereas climate is what you expect. And think of each day or each storm or each weather event as a single pixel. Right? That pixel doesn't show you the whole picture, you have to step back and all these individual pixels together start to tell you the big picture of what's really going on. What we're, what we're able to do now, is because we have all this data over a long period of time, we can now say, \"Okay, this Cyclone, wherever this, this hurricane, was likely 20 or maybe 30% worse than it would have been due to climate change.\" So you can never pinpoint one particular event and say that was caused by climate change, right? But you can look, like you said, look at that bigger picture and say, okay, we're seeing more of these forest fires, we're seeing more of these droughts in these places, we're seeing more floods in these places that are uncharacteristic. Venice, just the other day, or just, whatever, a week or so ago, had some of the worst flooding in 40 or 50 years, right? That was an event, that was one pixel, right?

Now that is at the extreme end and it could be less than that, it depends on the massive glaciers crumbling, but this is the gives you some sense of the order of magnitude that the scientists are thinking in terms of if those glaciers go. And you can imagine the impacts on our, on our coastal cities with flooding in that at that range. Whether it's a Halifax, a Vancouver, bigger cities like New York, or London, or Cape Town, or Miami.

I can talk about examples of this all day long, but I was in the island nation of Tuvalu. It's one of the least visited countries on planet Earth. They have one runway. There's two flights that arrive every week, one on Tuesday, and another one on Thursday. That's it. From Fiji. And it's a very low lying island nation. And when I was there, I talked to some of the government officials and they were literally genuinely concerned about the need to have to relocate their entire population, move the country because of sea level rise. And you don't have to have the sea level rise so much that it covers the entire island. It only has to get high enough so that it pollutes the drinking water supply. And basically they're worried about their water supply and food security because the salt water inundates their crops and they already depend on like too much imported food as it is. So they're living on this precarious balance right now. And they're not the only ones. There's Tuvalu, there's Kiribati, there's parts of Fiji, these very low lying islands, Maldives. And these islanders don't contribute to greenhouse gas emissions very much. But these people are the ones who are on the front lines. So thousands of miles away from all of these coal burning plants and the crowded streets of Beijing or Los Angeles, we're all these cars are burning up their fuel. There's these islanders who are genuinely concerned that they're going to have to leave their country and never ever go back. And the same thing is happening in places like Bangladesh. In southern Bangladesh, we met with people that are leaving because they would point out to the ocean and say that's where my farm used to be. It's just eroding into the sea. Every year, half a million people are relocating to the capital of Dhaka. We have climate change refugees right now. And thousands, and thousands, and thousands of them.

And it is appalling to see what has happened there. And it comes down to quite a few different factors, mismanagement of tourism, there's been pollutants and runoff, agricultural runoff has been poisoning the corals, the sea temperatures going up is one thing. They have a very narrow range of temperatures where they're able to survive the coral and the associated life forms that live amongst the coral. But also, with all this carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere, a lot of it is being absorbed by the ocean. And when you add carbon dioxide to water, you create carbonic acid. And what's happening is the pH level of the ocean is dropping, so it's getting more acidic. That is a big contributor to coral bleaching. And it's hard to find a pristine coral reef anywhere on planet Earth. Like the Great Barrier Reef has lost somewhere in the order of half of its coral, if not more. Like it is appalling what has been going on. I don't want to scare people and say that we're that we're doomed, but what I do want, the point I do want to get across is that this requires urgent attention."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "9:25", "text": "Another highly visible aspect of climate change is an increasing number and intensity of forest fires across the world, as we've seen with Australia and California. Occasionally, fires are a natural occurrence, and an important part of forests health. They redistribute nutrients and clear clutter to improve fertility of the soil. However, they can also be extremely damaging to ecosystems, as George tells us.

This past fire season in California was absolutely devastating, as was the year before, as was the year before that. So California burns every year, it seems, and the fire seasons are getting longer. One big problem that we're seeing, and we're predicting is going to get worse, is the movement of the jet stream in North America. So the jet stream is a high altitude river of air. And that's why it takes you less time to fly from California to New York than it does to fly from New York to California, because that high altitude river of air is flowing from west to east. But it's not a straight line, it undulates and dips up and down. When we have the polar vortex, that dreaded polar vortex, that's a dip in that jet stream that pulls all this cold air down from the Arctic. Well, as it raises and dips, it also can cause these droughts in places, these these really intense heat waves as well. So it's pulling this air up from from the equator. And in California, when you get hot, dry air, what does it do to all the foliage? Dries it out, turns it into a tinderbox, right. And over the past decade or so, California has been having these terrible, terrible droughts. Not a lot of rain, lots of heat, you get the Santa Ana winds, which are these very particular winds that you get in California that are very hot and very dry. And they are like taking a leaf blower to your campfire. Like it's just just pumping energy into it, right. So I really expect there to be more of these fires in places where we're seeing them now in Australia, in Alberta, in BC, and California as well, in particular."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "11:41", "text": "Forest fires, droughts, flooding, and extreme weather. These are some of the most devastating impacts predicted by leading climate scientists and models. What's worse, many of these effects contribute to positive feedback loops, accelerating climate change and making it harder to stop. For example, burning trees releases more carbon dioxide, while melting permafrost releases methane into the atmosphere. And as sea ice melts in the Arctic, the white of the ice and snow is being replaced by the blue of the ocean. It turns out, that color changes significant, since the white ice tends to reflect sunlight back into space, while the deep blue ocean tends to absorb heat."}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "12:18", "text": "Clearly, the impacts of climate change on our environment are already serious.

For the listeners who may not be aware, you know, Fort McMurray is 450 kilometers north of Edmonton. It is a town of about 80,000 people, and there are really no other communities around. So when you drive south of Fort McMurray as you go past the Fort McMurray airport, the road sign says that there is no service for the next 350 kilometers. So it's very remote. And so my research was focused on measuring lung function, doing health surveys and then collecting bio samples from participants. The specific research question that we wanted to answer was, what was the prevalence of abnormal lung function, post fires, and whether or not this changes over time? And the second question that we wanted to ask was, you know, could we correlate this with specific biomarkers in the blood and urine. The symptoms that most people complain of are cough and increase in sputum production, but it's been clearly shown that there is an increased risk of developing asthma or exacerbation of asthma and COPD as a result of the wildfires and wldfire smoke."}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "14:16", "text": "Dr. Chow explained that forest fires are not isolated events and affect both local and surrounding areas."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Chung-Wai Chow", "time": "14:21", "text": "The air knows no borders and the pollutants that come from one geographic region go to the other. The Fort McMurray fires began in northern Alberta, but then several weeks downstream, there was clearly an increase in respiratory symptoms and hospitalizations and hospital visits that actually affected the eastern seaboard. And so the fires that begin in one area will track downwind and will directly affect those people and communities that live there. And forest fires that are now occurring in Sydney, Australia probably will affect downstream as the air moves and circulates to regions of the world far away. And I think what has also changed in the last couple of years is a realization that forest fires is not an isolated problem, that it only affects very specific regions of the world. But in the last couple of years, and particularly in the summer of 2019, we have seen huge forest fires in many parts of the world where it has impacted communities. I mean, forest fires are in many respects, part of a natural ecological evolution, but I think what has changed in the last couple of years is the fact that forest fires are occurring in communities where people live.

But I think what I hope that this will do is it will actually allow policymakers to look at how communities are built, how close can we allow communities to be built, and housing to be built into into a forested regions, and how do we mitigate some of the changes. The other thing that I hope that will help, and this is not within my area, but I think that the big difference in Fort McMurray was that it wasn't just wildfires, it wasn't just a forest, but there was a huge amount of buildings and structures that were burnt. And that, you know, this may allow people to think about the different types of building materials that are used in areas that are fire prone. But in terms of the results for my study, which is looking at lung function, I think that, what I hope is, that once we publish this is that it allows people to, on a very individual basis, look at their own risk, looking at their, you know, what are their risks of lung disease or that if you have actually had lung disease, asthma, or allergies, that you may think a little bit about how you can sort of mitigate that."}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "17:51", "text": "We also spoke with Dr. Edward Xie, an emergency and family physician at the University of Toronto and a board member of CAPE: Canadian Association of Physicians for Environment."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Edward Xie", "time": "18:01", "text": "My name is Edward Xie, I work part time as an emergency doctor at University Health Network, and I'm also an Assistant Professor at University of Toronto in the Department of Family and Community Medicine. Most of my work centers around, or at least the academic work, centers and health equity and structural determinants of health."}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "18:16", "text": "We asked Dr. Xie if climate change had begun to impact any of his patients here in Canada."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Edward Xie", "time": "18:20", "text": "Yeah, so this is one of the questions I get asked most often, which is my own personal opinion as as a health care provider. And it's a bit tricky to answer. You know, there is this strange dichotomy between very large, slow onset, global scale weather pattern changes, and you know, what we see day to day. So, you know, from what I see in the emergency department, I can say that there are certain health outcomes that are going to become more likely, but whether anything in particular I can attribute to climate change is much more difficult to say. So like, one of the stories that really stands out for me is, you know, last summer during one of the heat waves, we had an elderly woman come in and she had actually collapsed at home due to heat exhaustion. When she came into the hospital, she was really struggling to breathe. And there were a lot of contributing factors to that. So part of it was, she was, you know, had lower income, she was elderly, so she had a fixed income. She couldn't afford air conditioning. She also had some chronic diseases. So she was, you know, had difficulty getting out of the home had some social isolation. So it was hard for her to move about, to seek cooling centers, or to go see her family doctor to get care when she was feeling worse. And so she ended up in dire straits because of the high heat and also contributing to our medical conditions. So this is one of the main reasons I became interested in climate change. And it came out of this interest in in trying to help marginalized and disadvantaged populations to improve their health outcomes. We know that for example, elderly people are more susceptible to heat, especially in Canada. There was a devastating heat wave in Quebec quite recently, and there were dozens of people who had premature deaths related to that. We also know that children are more vulnerable, just because of their physiology, and they may be in situations where they're not able to protect themselves."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Edward Xie", "time": "20:10", "text": "There are, you know, in terms of looking at global health issues, there are themes that are cross cutting across the entire world, including areas of Canada. And one of the main ones that I touched on a little bit earlier, was poverty. And so, you know, the patient in my case had a fixed income, they couldn't afford air conditioning. It wasn't an option to them. And that's, that's a major factor in people not being able to adapt to climate change. And I would say that there are a lot of communities in Canada that are resource poor in terms of financial resources, for example, but they are resource rich in terms of human resources and human potential. And that's making me think of Indigenous communities in Canada, who will be disproportionately affected and that that also goes Indigenous populations everywhere. There was actually a United Nations report on Indigenous issues that examine this and how dispossession of lands for example, and institutional and structural barriers are causing greater effects on Indigenous people. So I would say that they're not inherently vulnerable, they've actually been extremely resilient to not only climate change, but also a lot of the structural violence that's happened, but they, because of the position that a lot of people have been put in, they are more sensitive, they have had a lot of their ability to adapt taken away from them. So I would say I guess you know, they are resource rich in offering a lot of things for people to learn and I certainly have a lot to learn myself. You know, one of the best examples I have is I guess that we are on Dish With One Spoon territory. And so, you know, this this treaty between Anishinaabe and Haudenosaunee and Mississauga peoples was built around this idea that actually aligns really well with sustainable development. That, you know, we are here to share the land, and we need to be able to protect it so that future generations can thrive. And I think those are really important lessons that come from marginalized groups."}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "22:17", "text": "Dr. Xie also described how vulnerable groups may be disproportionately impacted in their ability to access health care."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Edward Xie", "time": "22:23", "text": "Some of the effects we're expecting in Canada are drier summers, which could contribute to more droughts and forest fires. But also, again, paradoxically, we may see wetter winters and springs and warmer temperatures that cause floods. So on the one hand, more fires, on the other hand, also more floods. And those can endanger, obviously, you know, large populations across Canada, but also their access to health systems. You know, one of the the examples that I've heard is in a northern community where their access to health care is actually dependent on ice roads. And when those are melting or the the ice conditions are uncertain, it makes it much more difficult to access health care. And we are also, for example, seeing that in areas where there's large scale flooding, it can be more difficult to access health care, it can lead to more health issues related to the flooding itself, like water and food contamination. And it reduces the resiliency of our health infrastructure if there's potentially damaging storms. And it makes it harder for hospitals, for example, to keep themselves open. So if there is a major storm that cuts off electricity, hospitals then have to rely on generators to keep the electricity going. And if you know a hospital needs more electricity, using the generator is less efficient. And so there are many different effects on the health system, not just within Canada but also otherwise. We know that the the Canadian health system relies a lot on resources that come from other parts of the world. So a lot of our medicines, for example, come from other parts of the world. You know, one of the examples where we saw that there was a global impact that was felt locally was with Hurricane Maria, which happened a couple years ago. Hurricane Maria was an extremely intense storm. It hit Puerto Rico, where there was a major facility that produced saline. And in the weeks following that, there was actually a saline shortage across North America. And that was felt in many hospitals across Canada. And it's one of these things where, you know, we can't say climate change cause that. We can say that the types of storms that that cause this problem are going to be more likely because of climate change. And so we may have issues related to supply chain. I'm interested in these structural determinants of health. And they said that climate change threatens to undo the last 50 years of progress that we've made in development, poverty and global health. And so this, you know, people think of it as an environmental issue, but it is extremely pervasive in our lives. You know, as I've talked about, it affects food prices, it can affect national security in terms of conflict, it can affect our health, obviously, as well, and so it will touch on every aspect of our lives."}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "25:24", "text": "Gideon Forman, from the David Suzuki foundation, further describe the impacts of climate change on larger economic and human systems."}, {"speaker": "Gideon Forman", "time": "25:31", "text": "Lesser known in terms of health impacts is the loss of productivity. The Lancet had an article in December of last year where they estimated the number of hours in 2017 lost to productivity because of the climate crisis, and they came up with this number that I still find staggering: 150 billion hours in lost productivity in 2017 alone. This is days when the scientists estimated that people weren't able to go outside because of the heat. Most of those hours lost, were in the south, the global south, and many of them in agriculture. You can imagine the impact on our ability to feed ourselves if the heat is so severe that people are not able to go outside to plant crops or to harvest them. So the loss in productivity is also a health impact. It's a lesser known one, but also one that we need to be mindful of to understand this crisis. The other aspect of climate change, or the climate crisis, as we call it now, is that it's also a humanitarian challenge. And the scientists have been saying this for a number of years now, because of climate crisis, people are going to be on the move from things like flooding and drought, and many of them will become refugees. And so it could become the defining or most significant humanitarian challenge of the 21st century because of the refugees that it produces."}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "26:52", "text": "Back to Dr. Xie, who's also worked as a physician with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders.

The hospital that I'd been working in had been damaged in the fighting, and didn't have regular medical staff. So Doctors Without Borders was trying to rehabilitate the hospital and build trust with the local population. And one of the contributors that came out of some evidence, some  research that was done around that conflict was that there was a severe drought, one of the worst ones for a very long time. And it led to crop failures. And that led to large scale population migration in the in the country and then to political unrest and then conflict. So in that case, you know, climate change could have been one of the contributing factors to it."}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "27:56", "text": "He also described the complexities involved for refugee camps created because of changes in climate."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Edward Xie", "time": "28:01", "text": "It's a, it's a complex issue. So I'll try to pick apart some of the pieces. I have not personally worked in one. I was working close to one. So we would see refugees every once in a while. And I guess the first thing I would say is, you know, one of the reasons why it's a complex issue is that climate induced migration is not covered under most of the the international conventions on on the rights of refugees. So the 1951 convention, for example, and some of the protocols that came afterwards, don't recognize this type of threat in terms of climate. So there are potentially fewer protections for people who are forced to leave because of climate changes. The second thing is, you know, the reason why we have camps to begin with, you know, part of the reason is for protection of people to have people in one place where they can be provided services, where there can be enhanced security, but one of the issues with with having camps, or one of the reasons why there are overcrowded camps is that we don't have these international mechanisms in place, such as conventions that allow movement of climate migrants, but also that we we don't allow free movement of refugees. We don't have great systems of helping to integrate refugees into host populations, and ways of allowing people who are refugees to easily gain livelihoods in the places that they end up. And so all of those factors contribute. And also we are going to run into this question more and more in the coming years because there are large areas of the world that will be affected by extreme weather events, mainly in terms of droughts, in terms of coastal flooding, in terms of more severe storms, that could send many more people into situations where they are forced to flee or they're, pushed into situations where they've lost their homes or livelihoods and they need to move."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "30:05", "text": "Climate change is expected to exacerbate a number of existing vulnerabilities on a global scale, especially security of income, housing and food.

Health impacts from mosquitoes and ticks: the mosquitoes and ticks are becoming something of a poster child for the health impacts of climate change. You've probably seen these before, but the models do suggest with more grassland in Canada and greater heat we're more likely to see mosquito populations increasing and with that increases in West Nile. And of course, with the black legged tick now better able to survive our winters we're more likely to see increased Lyme disease. I gave a talk just last week actually the University of Ottawa medical school chatting with some doctors there, and they were saying until recently, they hadn't seen Lyme disease at all in Canada. So it's really quite a new phenomenon. The trajectory the vector, of course, is the is the black legged tick, and our winters used to be more punishing, they're now warmer, more moderate. And so the tick is more able to survive our winters,"}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "31:32", "text": "Dr. Shear spoke more about how Canada is being impacted."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Edward Xie", "time": "31:35", "text": "So speaking from a Canadian perspective, there are certain disease vectors that are climate sensitive, and by that I mean some of the changes that are going to happen with climate change are going to make Canada more favorable or more suitable for them. So Lyme disease would be a big one.  The black legged tick, it has a hard time surviving cold winters, but as Canada warms more and more we know that Canada is already warming twice as fast as the global average, we know that that tick that its territory can move north by about 50 kilometers a year. So we're starting to see in the last several years that the number of Lyme disease cases has increased several fold. And that's because the the conditions for them to survive are much better. It's actually a problem in a lot of Canada, Ontario is one of the worst affected. Also Nova Scotia has a large tick problem. We also are seeing more mosquito vectors in Canada.  And in the last few years for the first time there's a mosquito that can transmit dengue and Zika and chikungunya, and it's being detected in Canada in Windsor as one of the southernmost points. So it's a major concern in Canada because we're going to potentially be exposed to diseases that we haven't been before. In the rest of the world, it's a huge problem, especially for lower middle income countries that have health systems that have yet to be strengthened. We will see potentially hundreds of millions of people exposed to dengue, we are potentially going to see also millions of people who will be exposed to malaria in areas where there wasn't malaria before. So for example, areas at high altitude where the mosquito generally wouldn't be able to survive we're seeing that the mosquito territory also spread as well."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "33:32", "text": "Could you tell us a little more about how those mosquito ranges are affected?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Edward Xie", "time": "33:36", "text": "I'm gonna just qualify that by saying I'm certainly not an expert in this. So the reason why they might be able to spread more is that the mosquito territory expands. So some of the conditions that make it easier for the mosquito to grow and breed are warmer temperatures, higher humidity, and so we're seeing in certain parts of the world that the weather conditions are becoming more suitable for them. So we know that below certain temperatures, the mosquitoes really are not very active, or it's harder for the virus to replicate. So that's one of the reasons. The other reason is an interaction with human behavior and the way human systems works. So, if you know this is this is almost a contrary example, or it's paradoxical in that if you have a region with drought, and you no longer, for example, have piped water sources, people are more likely to store water in containers. And, if those containers are open, they become mosquito breeding grounds."}, {"speaker": "Jesse Knight", "time": "34:38", "text": "Okay, that's it for the doom and gloom.

"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Edward Xie", "time": "34:50", "text": "This can be it can be anxiety provoking for people you know. There's this term I've heard of climate paralysis where the scale of the problem can be it can be be so big that it's hard to know what to do. And that's where I really liked your question about focusing on, you know, some personal things that that we can do to make an impact. And I'm going to reframe it a little bit as well, because, you know, sometimes there can be a bit too much of a focus on personal responsibility. And we do offer personal responsibility, but we also have to put that in the context of these structural factors that really mold our architecture of choice. And we have to look at both so personally, what I would say is, and this is work that's actually been done through the Government of Ontario, they looked at what was the biggest carbon footprint for Ontarians. And they found it was four things. Let me see if I can remember them. So I think the first one was driving, it was transportation that way, there was also flying, household heating, and meat based diets. And so those four things made up more than half of the contribution, like the carbon footprint of Ontarians. And so I would say, you know, for people looking to make a big impact, those would be the four that I would target. So, you know, eating a healthier diet, so having less meat in the diet would be something that people could do and something that I've done myself. And then in terms of transportation, looking at what trips can be avoided. And so I found that there was a lot of travel that was something that I didn't need to do. So for example, I personally found that it was much easier to rent a car when I needed a car rather than owning one. So I don't own a car, but that is that's a choice that can be more difficult for people, for example, in rural communities where there are long distances to get around. So I would say in those cases, it's not a hard and fast rule, for example, but to cut out the trips that are not necessary, and that includes flying as well. You know, I am actually reflecting on something I read recently in Healthy Debate, and I believe this was Andreas Laupacis, who wrote about this culture and academia of flying to go to international conferences. And this is seen as something that's very prestigious and it leads to academic advancement, that you're able to go speak or attend an international conference. And unfortunately, you know, all this flying around contributes quite a bit to some of the problems that we're trying to solve in terms of health and global health. And so we need to look at ways that we can connect with with each other that don't require consuming more fossil fuels and contributing to the problem. And so for example, I'm trying to have a lot more meetings through teleconference. And I know the medical community is moving that way as well in terms of things like telemedicine and virtual care. And I think, you know, as that type of technology gets better, we can connect with each other in ways that don't involve having to travel as much.

Unfortunately, we have a government in the United States right now, that is certainly not playing the global game.

I've been a vegetarian since I was 18, except for the time I ate lard and Byelorussia by mistake, but and then I'm flying less. I'm flying more consciously.

This is where I think the advocacy matters and where we're looking at the big impacts. The small actions add up. So in Toronto in Canada, we should take the actions that we know are out there to reduce our footprint cycle more, fly less, then I think we can also use our voices. I think that matters too, and to say what kind of local community we want to live in, because that impacts on what kind of world we want to live in. I think what we can help do is talk about who's suffering and understand a bit more about, you know, why that's happening and contribute to that conversation.

What we miss when we focus on that is all these opportunities to improve people's health at the same time as being more sustainable. So for example, you know, if we follow Canada's food guide that can lead to healthier diets, but it also reduces the environmental impact through a focus on plant based proteins, and on eating habits that could potentially reduce waste, food waste, as well. Other health co-benefits that are really obvious would be things like active lifestyles and exercise that could potentially reduce fossil fuel use in terms of transportation and also make people healthier in terms of the chronic conditions that they're living with. We also see of really key importance to primary care, this rule of preventive care. We know that if we keep someone or if we help someone to stay healthy in the community, they use much fewer resources, their health care is much less intensive than if we have to treat them in the hospital. And that translates into reduced emissions and also means that people are living healthier lives and they're enjoying more of that wellness than if they end up in a hospital because of worse health. I want to point out one other thing which I thought was very interesting and this was when I was looking through  the choosing wisely guidelines, the recommendations, and there was a submission from family doctors. And what they really do is they focus on reducing unnecessary testing, unnecessary resource use, unnecessary treatments. And I want to bring that back to the health co-benefits aspect where you know, we are by lessening this unnecessary healthcare, we're actually reducing the burden on patients on the healthcare system. We're spending less money on these tests that are not needed, but it also reduces our impact on the environment because we know that the health care system in Canada contributes about 5 or 6% of the greenhouse gas emissions of Canada as a whole.

We invited members of the community, from people who were in the leadership roles in the school district, to emergency services, to the community health services of Fort McMurray to attend. And as we shared the information, there was a lot of very practical things in terms of how do we move forward? And how do we address these issues that come up? One of the advantages of working in a remote community in an isolated community that you have the ability to actually bring the group together and to share that information, and then to actually think about developing solutions."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "50:33", "text": "Of course, a major part of these solutions, are governments, as Dr. Chow explained."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Chung-Wai Chow", "time": "50:38", "text": "I think, first of all, I think the governments need to acknowledge that climate change is a problem and to really collectively do something about it. I think, you know, it's, I appreciate that governments often times, like all of us, look at things that is beneficial to their catchment population, sometimes a lot of it is very much driven by economics. And clearly things that we do that improves climate may have some negative impacts. But I think the first action is that for some of the leading nations around the world to acknowledge that this is in fact a problem, and that we need to actually act on it."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Edward Xie", "time": "51:22", "text": "I think policy makers do understand at some level that climate change is a major issue. You can tell him choosing my words a little bit carefully here. But I, you know, I do get the sense that a lot of policymakers are choosing to ignore certain aspects of it, or are taking a more short term focus. So I think there's a lot of focus on, for example, what's happening with the economy right now, but we know with a lot of the science that's come out that once you factor in the social costs, the health costs, and the economic costs of climate change, those will far outweigh any short term costs that we're experiencing now. And so if we are trying to make sure that Canada, you know, as a country is able to grow sustainably that, you know, we're not giving up our future potential, there needs to be a more of a long term focus. But, that's also where it's important to have these decision architectures, structural choices that we need, so that we don't have to bear this cognitive burden of having to continuously make choices. So carbon pricing, for example, is something that I think is extremely important. What it does is it allows this background mechanism to operate in a way that shifts decision making in a way that's better for Canadian societies that's more environmentally sustainable, but also helps people out. So, for example, you know, we we are seeing that food prices are going up by, I think it was 17% for vegetables in the last year, and then projected to be a few hundred dollars in the next year.  The rebates and the incentives from carbon pricing will help people and lower incomes be able to manage that. Some of the other, you know, things that that need to be built into these larger structural programs is helping people who the way our economy is structured now, may end up being losers. So for example, you know, smallholder farmers, people who are involved in extractive industries, we need to have some form of a just transition that helps people out in those those fields. And what I would say for people personally, to take away from this is, you know, there are these large scale issues to think about going from day to day, I think it's important to remember and keep in mind the reasons why we're doing this, you know that the children born today are going to be the people who will be disproportionately affected, who may not be able to live the same lives that were able to live because of the climate change that we are continuing to perpetuate. And that, you know, health is the most important thing to ourselves and our families. And because of the risks to health and climate change, it's one of the most important things that we need to be working on right now."}, {"speaker": "Gideon Forman", "time": "54:28", "text": "I think what we've seen in the last few months, last year with Greta Thunberg and the Friday's for Future movement is, at least for me, extremely heartening.

In our exploration of meaning, we will learn about ecstatic seizures, achieving wellbeing, finding a flow state, addressing the rise of a meaning crisis, and zombies. We were joined by our first guest today all the way from Switzerland, to hear about her unique research. Dr. Fabienne Picard is a neurologist and senior consultant in the EEG and epilepsy unit at the neurology department at the University Hospital of Geneva. Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to experience even a moment of complete self awareness and serenity associated with feeling like you fully understand the universe and your place in it? In the first part of today's episode, we wanted to begin by taking a brain anatomy centered approach to the study of meaning and the feeling of well being. Dr. Picard taught us about ecstatic epileptic seizures, a way in which it may be possible to scientifically study a sense of meaning, and what occurs in our body during times of increased awareness and presence in the moment."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Fabienne Picard", "time": "3:46", "text": "In the case of an ecstatic aura, the patient feels a sudden state of bliss and complete serenity. This wonderful state seems to be related to a sudden dive into the present moment. There is a complete centeredness on the present moment, with the ability to contemplate everything without any judgment, as well as an absolute absence of worries. And the patients use different terms to describe the state of ecstasy. They speak about revelation or an epiphany, an understanding or hyper reality or a state of clarity. And I would like to add that during this ecstatic epileptic seizures, the patients feel an increased sense of self, an increased self awareness, and often much more vivid perception of the external world, with more colors, more details, and they may report a sense of union with the universe. They say that they suddenly understand everything, the meaning of life, that everything is straightforward and beautiful. But it is important to, to bear in mind that an epileptic seizure is a dynamic process, which can spread out to other parts of the brain, and that says a patient may have convulsions immediately after the ecstatic aura. In other words, the term ecstatic is related to the very beginning of the seizure."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "5:48", "text": "Neurons in our brain are hyper excitable during a seizure, and they spontaneously synchronize together to fire at the same time. An example of this that we often think or hear about is when a seizure occurs and the motor cortex, which then causes a person to involuntarily shake or move. To better understand ecstatic seizures, and what we can learn about meaning and well being from them, let's hear more about the neuro cognitive processes underlying this specific type of seizure. So where does it all begin? In a small region of the brain called the insula."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Fabienne Picard", "time": "6:19", "text": "The insula has many roles, but the main function of the insula is the interoception. The posterior insula is a location where all the internal signals arrive from the inside of the body, from the heart from the respiration, the bladder, the stomach."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "6:44", "text": "interoception, as Dr. Picard tells us, is our sense of what is happening in our body or physiological state. External signals from our environment will shape and provide context for these internal signals within the anterior insula. In other words, we will interpret these external signals in the form of emotions and feelings through the insula. Interoception helps us understand what's happening in our own bodies. How does our brain anticipate external signals based on our previous experiences though? Dr. Picard explains that the area predictive coding, which understands the brain to function as a predictive machine, and not just a passive receiver of environmental cues."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Fabienne Picard", "time": "7:25", "text": "well, the brain is always anticipating the signals which are arriving from the external world, and from the inside of the body by predictions, which are also these quite top-down signals. And when the real incoming signal arrives, so when's the bottom-up outcome is received by the brain, the prediction and the real signal will be compared them and the mismatch, the difference, will give rise to the production a prediction error and this prediction error will allow to update the next prediction. So, there is a sort of cycle with always a prediction made by the brain, a real signal arriving, a comparison between real signal and the prediction, giving rise to a prediction error, and then an update of the next prediction. The aim of the brain is to have the future predictions the closest possible to the real signals which are arising up to minimize the surprise and to minimize energetic expenditure."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "8:46", "text": "Now that we have a better understanding of the normal function of the insula and the regular occurrence of predictive errors, let's circle back to the role, or rather the abnormal function of the anterior insula in ecstatic seizures."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Fabienne Picard", "time": "8:59", "text": "So Because of this abnormal functioning of the insula during the seizure, there cannot be prediction errors in the field of interoception. This would be equivalent to an absence of mismatch between the predictions and the incoming signals in the field of interoception, and therefore, in the field of emotions. In other words, there would be a complete absence, of surprise, of conflict in the physiological state of the body, which is the case in our daily life and the positive emotions which are described by the patients are probably secondary to the stability the state of the body, and to the consequence center- centeredness on the present moment. So, I don't think that the ecstatic epileptic seizure have primarily positive emotions, but these positive emotions are related to, to this state of, of the body without any surprise."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "10:14", "text": "Although, of course, we will not all experience and ecstatic seizure for comparison, we're all continuously coming up against different magnitudes of prediction errors between what we expect and what actually occurs. How large these errors are, and how we respond to them differs between individuals and might provide insight into that person's sense of well being."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Fabienne Picard", "time": "10:34", "text": "We used to believe that the perception of the external world was passive perception of stable, external world which would have been the same for everyone. We know now that our past experiences play a role in the predictions we make about the immediate future and that these past experiences will influence and shape our perceptions. So, the interpretation of the external world will depend actually on the selection of our predictions best fitting together, but our predictions play a major role in our perceptions. And these predictions which are continuously updated, participate, as well as the real incoming signals for perceptions, so I insists a little bit. Some also even say our emotions, our feelings and our sense of wellness, self consciousness, are actually the result of the succession of interoceptive prediction, predictions rather than the result of the succession of the real incoming interceptive signals. So it's interesting to, to know that our, our self consciousness is not the result of, of what arrives but also of what we predict."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "12:18", "text": "It is quite fascinating that we can use neuroscience and the study of static epileptic seizures to help us towards understanding the neuro basis of self awareness, wellbeing, and positive emotions. However, what does this mean for us in our day to day lives? The human experience of increasing self awareness and finding meaning and purpose is one that is universal, yet unique to each of us. One field of study aims to help people to find meaning in their lives by prioritizing wellbeing: The field of positive psychology. Although it is a relatively new field, it has attracted a lot of interest. We spoke with Dr. Tayyab Rashid, a clinical psychologist at the Health and Wellness Center at the University of Toronto Scarborough and president of the clinical division of the International Positive Psychology Association. Dr. Rashid spoke with us about how he uses positive psychology and his clinical practice to help people achieve a sense of wellbeing. But first, what exactly is positive psychology? Dr. Rashid begins by describing positive psychology using the acronym PERMA."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Tayyab Rashid", "time": "13:26", "text": "Positive Psychology deconstructs wellbeing as less of happiness but more of wellbeing into five elements: P stands for positive emotions, E for engagement, which is synonymous with flow, states of deep absorption, R for relationships, they are fundamental, one of the most important predictors of our wellbeing, now actually also predictors of our mortality and lots of health status indices, P positive emotions, E engagement, R relationship, M meaning, as I said is pursuit of meaning, and last one is accomplishment. But accomplishment not bigger, people miss- sometimes misconstrue them accomplishment not for external rewards, extrinsic motivations necessarily, but using your strengths, using your own intrinsic motivation to do something to pursue goals which unfolds your potential for the betterment of your own wellbeing and of others. I will ask our listeners, anyone among our listener, listeners who is completely a saint, or who's completely a sinners, those states don't exist. We are a curious and complex mix of positive and negative, Yin and Yang. In my view, positive psychology is a process of bringing the best out of people. It's of people, of individuals, of communities, and it is setting the things which are right and ripe for people to be able to flourish."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "15:11", "text": "So it sounds like it's a reframing of what we may think of as traditional psychology in terms of wellbeing more so looking at, like you said, the flourishing side."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Tayyab Rashid", "time": "15:21", "text": "Yes, it's reframing in a sense that, I don't want to give this notion, although it's called positive psychology, the rest of psychology is negative. Psychiatry, psychology, social work, and many other healing professions have done tremendous work in terms of making ourselves manage our stresses better. We have a number of clinical conditions for which we have empirically based treatments. But why positive psychology is important in terms of reframing is it is expanding the frames. It is adding the lens in that frame of wellness, that if we were looking at human beings traditionally from a deficit-based frame, as damaged goods, as people who have genetic accidents, and that they were destined to have anxiety, depression because of biological underpinning, or they were, let's say cruel victim of very unfriendly socioeconomic conditions. So, psychology as a mental health field was mostly about this damage control. Genetic social economic or their interaction, but what positive psychology has brought in the lens of that: yes a person is may have a lot of injuries, but also they bring lots of assets as well."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "17:03", "text": "Although Dr. Rashid currently leads Flourish, a preventative Mental Health Initiative for students at the University of Toronto Scarborough, he first began his clinical practice working with children and families."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Tayyab Rashid", "time": "17:14", "text": "I've worked in some of the toughest neighborhoods of the city, and working with the families who have very challenging circumstances. So some of my initial work was with students as a school psychologist. And I'll give an example. I was given a referral, and the teacher said, Dr. Rashid, I'm pretty sure this kid has ADHD."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "17:45", "text": "Dr. Rashid observed that this child was experiencing many challenges within the classroom setting, but he was also curious to see the child's interactions and experiences outside of the classroom."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Tayyab Rashid", "time": "17:56", "text": "The most remarkable thing was he was having challenges in the classroom, but also, I had the opportunity, I wanted to also tease out his strengths, so I went to one of the play [areas] on the morning breaks. And I saw this kid. It was absolute astonishing display that, he went, it was a play break and he was leading the basketball team. And he told: you go there, you go there, you go there, you go there. He coordinated and he was, there was a leadership in him. And he knew his spatial perception was excellent."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "18:48", "text": "Positive Psychology, as Dr. Rashid explains, is about bringing out the best in each other, looking for and focusing on each other's strengths, as well as our own.

First couple of sessions, just could not look at me in the eyes. Severe social anxiety. And after building some, some moderate rapport, I asked them to tell me a, some time, some story, an act where they were very proud, and this is the story. It's a brief one. They said, I loved basketball. I was probably one of the good players, and they wrote the story, and they're telling the story without looking at me. But I was so socially shy that I could never bring myself to get the coach's attention. And one time, we were at an away game. It was the last game of the season, and one of the key player got injured, and there was no one else. The coach has no choice but to cue me to come to the court. And this is exactly I remember the words, I stepped in the coat, and hundreds of piercing eyes were looking at me. I was, I had a panic attack. But then I forgot everything, and I played, entire season I played for three minutes, and I scored three points. And those three points took my team to the next round."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "20:27", "text": "We can each find ourselves in daunting or unfamiliar circumstances where we may feel limited or incapable. But what if those exact situations which cause feelings of anxiety and fear are also those that shape how we experience happiness, and meaning in our lives? Dr. Rashid has worked with refugee families, as well as individuals who live through the 9/11 attacks. We asked him how a positive psychology approach is used when working with individuals with lived traumatic experiences."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Tayyab Rashid", "time": "20:58", "text": "One of the couple of things about trauma, trauma is about crisis as well as opportunities. Of course as careful and responsible clinicians and providers, we need to be aware what is the immediate needs of the, of our patients and whatever we need to do to take care of them. Those needs, we should attend to them and there are protocols for that. I'm all for that. The only added piece that I sometimes am able to bring in working with people who have experienced trauma, if appropriate, I would may also ask them about how they have previously dealt with similar situations. Because we are, all of us and most listeners will agree with me that they have dealt with a situation and somehow or other they overcame it. So just bringing that piece of efficacy, self efficacy is, can be motivating. I'll tell you a story about trauma. In our clinic we gave strengths measure along with symptoms. And I wrote the strengths measure. And this is the first session, and the client came in and I looked at their profile then on my on my medical charts and it looked, their top strength was gratitude. And I also look at the history and it was you can name it. It had everything: young person but had experienced a multiple traumas from family turmoil to addiction issues to homelessness, and many other things. And, and I sort of scratch my head and I said, How is the gratitude your top strength, and they said to me that I went through lots of situations in my life and one time it was dead of the winter. I don't know how I reached I arrived there but I woke up and I saw people who had just passed out of drugs. And I was probably one of the youngest one around them. And it was the dead of the winter and I looked out, the sun was shining, and the sky was blue. I profusely started crying and I said to myself, if I kept on going like this, I would never see another blue sky like this. I checked out and then, long story short they found, somehow ways to to get treatment and they remarkably remarkably entered university on a scholarship and, and when they are narrating the story in this very office, and it was winter, and it was snow outside, ironically and also the sky was blue and they say, Exactly whenever I look at this blue sky, I'm reminded of that time. So tell me Dr. Rashid, why I shouldn't be grateful."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "24:33", "text": "In this episode so far, we've learned about meaning and well being through neuroscience and positive psychology lens. We wanted to shed light on another important perspective on this discussion. One that is certainly more unique for us at Raw Talk, and perhaps for you our listeners as well. We had the absolute pleasure of sitting down with Dr. John Vervaeke, who is an Associate Professor in the Cognitive Science department at the University of Toronto. He also teaches courses for the Buddhism, Psychology and Mental Health program. His work is on the nature of intelligence, rationality, wisdom, consciousness, mindfulness, and insight. We spoke with him to help us explore a more philosophical and cognitive understanding of meaning."}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Vervaeke", "time": "25:15", "text": "So, I think the very cognitive processes that make us adaptive also make us beset to self deceptive, self destructive behavior. And what has happened is across, you know, historical and cultural context, societies has developed practices, what I call psycho technologies, these are sets of practices that fit the mind and alter cognitive behavior, and they developed ecologies of such practices, ecologies of psycho technology to address these patterns of self deceptive and self destructive behavior, and try to ameliorate them and then also to do the opposite to afford an enhanced sense of connection that can often be lost due to self deception and self destructive behavior and health. But these, they want to also enhance their sense of connectedness to themselves, to each other, and the world. And that's, that's what I ultimately think we're talking about when we're talking about meaning in life. We're using the word meaning as a metaphor for this sense of being connected in deep and significant ways."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "26:15", "text": "In the past, humans have turned to wisdom and use culturally homed practices to address this lack of meaning and life. However, Dr. Vervaeke explains that somehow our current society has lost touch with this wisdom, and has led us to what we are now facing: a meaning crisis. Dr. Vervaeke describes this meaning crisis in great detail in his YouTube series, which is fascinating and we highly suggest you check it out. We will have it linked in our episode show notes. In order to address the meaning crisis in today's society, we need a way to integrate this wisdom back into our culture."}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Vervaeke", "time": "26:52", "text": "I think we generally use the term wisdom for those sets of practices that help people to deal with self deceptive, self destructive behavior and to afford the enhancement of meaning in life. Those, you know, enhancing those sense of connections. So there has to be a worldview, a worldview, that helps people model what kind of agent they should be, and model the world for it's an arena in which actions make sense. That's why if you go to a culture that you're unfamiliar with you experienced such profound cultural shock, you'll experience loneliness, you'll experience kind of a fast version of the meaning crisis. Now why is that? Because we're experiencing the kind of shock, the cultural shock in this way. Given that the this ecology of practices needs a cultural home, in order to [sic] safe, the cultivation of wisdom, we can take a look and see if we have such a worldview that legitimates and guides a set of wisdom practices. And we don't. So people people know in the west where to turn for information and knowledge, but now, if you ask them and I frequently do what where do you go for wisdom? It's like well... and they mumble, and they cough and stuff like that."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "28:04", "text": "Dr. Vervaeke explains that this crisis is not something an individual can ignore. These patterns of self deceptive and self destructive behavior need to be addressed. But when people try to address this crisis and an autodidactic way, it actually worsens the crisis because our efforts are tainted with our own cognitive biases. Social media plays a huge role and exacerbating the meaning crisis by making it seem like we're talking with other people interacting and connecting with others. But in reality, it is masking the fact that people are trying to deal with this wisdom famine in a lonely and fragmented manner."}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Vervaeke", "time": "28:39", "text": "Given that's the case we can, like I said, we can then ask a couple questions. We could ask, how did we get here? What is the historical pathway that has led to a worldview in which we don't know how to cultivate wisdom? And here's the thing about the scientific worldview, it explains so much, but what it doesn't give us any good explanation of is how we make meaning, how how we actually do science, how we actually generate these explanations how, right? And we deeply don't understand how we pursue the truth if we can't understand how we cultivate meaning, and how we find our agency within that meaning making. And so this is what people are struggling with. And this is why sort of truth has become such a contentious issue for us. So you can ask historical questions of how did we get here? And then you can also ask cognitive scientific questions. What is this meaning making machinery? Let's try and bring the best cognitive science we can to bear on that. So maybe we can explain it in such a way that we can then refit it back into a solid scientific worldview and then start once again talking in a collective way, guided by our best scientific knowledge of what it would mean to cultivate wisdom and meaning and human life."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "29:53", "text": "In Dr. Vervaeke's YouTube series we mentioned earlier, he explains that one of the reasons we have gotten to this point is because of an increasing sense of bullshit in our society. What is this bullshit exactly in our day to day lives, and how is it making us withdraw from reality and ultimately contributing to our lack of meaning?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Vervaeke", "time": "30:12", "text": "Excellent question. [laughs] So, the notion that I use is inspired by Harry Frankfurt's seminal work: his essay on bullshit. And so he laid down the basic idea, and then I do some implications of it. I think they're fairly obvious implications. So I don't I can't actually see him in any way disagreeing with what I'm saying. So that's why I attributed this ultimately to him. So Frankfurt makes a distinction between the liar and the bullshit artist and his distinction is that the liar, the liar depends on a shared commitment to the truth. So the liar depends on the fact that you care about the truth in order to try and manipulate your behavior. They tell you something that isn't true, as if it is true, so that your commitment to the truth will alter your behavior. So, although lying is evil, I'm not trying to excuse it. And it's pernicious, right? And it destroys trust and all of those very important things. I'm not ignoring any of that. But the thing about the liar is he's, he or she is at least still committed to the value of truth. And in fact, lying depends on it. But the bullshit artists works differently, according to Frankfurt. The bullshit artist tries to get you to be indifferent as to whether or not something is true. They try to get it so that you're not caring about whether or not it's true. And that's how they're trying to direct your behavior. So I looked at that and I said, Well, what is the bullshit artists doing? Like, how are they motivating your behavior? And this is where I think it's important to realize that a lot of our behavior isn't driven just by our beliefs, a lot of our behavior is driven by what's happening within our conscious perspective. So for example, let me give this example: you watch this commercial where people are drinking alcohol, right? And, the person is happy and healthy and there's all these beautiful people around them and that's not what it's like in the bar. It's just not like that. And you know, it's not like that. And you know that alcohol actually makes you feel miserable the next day and destruct. So you don't believe what you're seeing? Right. But the point is, what does the commercial do? It makes it irrelevant whether or not you believe it. They know you don't believe it, and you know that they know and everybody knows. And so the concern for the truth is put aside. But nevertheless, what happens? Independent of your belief, you find the alcohol attractive. It stands out for you. It's salient, you're attracted to it. And so you buy the product. That's why they invest all this money in these advertising. Now, that's a form of bullshitting. Right, that's a funnel bullshitting. And what's happening is and we see this becoming more pervasive, the concern for the truth is dropping away. And all that matters is how attracted people are to certain ideas to certain patterns of behavior, etc. Now, what is especially pernicious about this is because the connection to truth and reality are separate, you can see right away, how that's going to undermine your meaning it's going to undermine your connectivity, right? To yourself, to each other, to the world. So right there, you can see it undermining meaning. But here's a second way which undermines meaning. The thing about, we use this metaphor for self deception: we say we lie to ourselves, you can't actually lie to yourself. You can't say, Hey, I don't really believe that Susan loves me. But I'm going to say to myself, Susan loves me. It doesn't work that way. And part of the problem is, is because belief is not something you have voluntary control over. You can't like pick a belief you'd like to have pick up. Everybody loves you. Okay, believe it, go. Do it. Doesn't work. Belief doesn't work that way. But the thing is attention and salience - how things stand out for you and attraction - they work in a much different fashion. They work outside of that belief machinery. Right? So I could simply make something salient to you. If I say your right hand, you're suddenly aware of it and stands for you. Now making something a little bit more salient makes it more attractive. Now notice how your attention keeps wanting to go back to your right hand right now. Oh, how's my right hand doing? Right? Right? So notice what I can do, I can direct my attention to make something salient. And then that will make it a little bit more attractive. So it's more likely to catch my attention, right? And then we'll notice what happens, and then it catches my attention, so I pay attention to it more, and you see how it feeds on itself. And then what I do is I can bullshit myself until I'm super attracted to things. And then what happens is all the biasing mechanisms are being kicked into place, right by all of this, these fields of attraction. So I will, I will start to form beliefs eventually that are appropriate to the and that's how I deceive myself. That's how I deceive myself. So not only does bullshitting undermine the connectivity to realness by undermining our primordial care and concern for the truth, it also undermines meaning by making us vulnerable to self deception. And of course those two things are linked. The more somebody, the more vulnerable I am to bullshitting myself. The more prey I am to other people bullshitting me and those all reinforce each other."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "35:11", "text": "As Dr. vacati mentions, we could all fall prey to bullshitting.

Because if you don't have that filtering ability, like so, this is what I do my major scientific work on. The amount of information that's actually available in this room is overwhelming, its vast. You can't pay attention to most of it. Also, all the information being generated by your body, all the information available into your long term memory, and then all the possible courses of action. You could you could get up and sing right now if you wish. Right? Right? This is the problem, this is the issue I call relevance realization: You're constantly, your brain is constantly at many levels, many scales, many scopes, it is trying to determine what the relevant information is, because it needs to zero in on the information that's relevant to whatever problems or tasks it's trying to address. So it's always having to screen off. So see what I'm trying to show you that that that machinery which is the core to your adaptive intelligence, your ability to fit to the world, in a way in which things are relevant to you and you connected to you is also the machinery that makes you prey to bias and self deception. And this is why it's a deep and difficult problem to address. And you can't address it just by sort of having theoretical beliefs. You have to fundamentally get to the guts of that attentional and agentic machinery and transform it in a profound way. That's why I say awakening from the meaning crisis and not just solving the meaning crisis."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "36:53", "text": "In psychology and Buddhist philosophy, we come across a term called ego. Many psychologists and philosophers have referred to the dissolution of our ego as an important step towards becoming awakened or enlightened. However, the concept of the ego has distinct definitions depending on the context, and is often incorrectly used in our everyday language. We asked Dr. Vervaeke to define this concept for us and explain it to utility and helping individuals awaken from the meaning crisis."}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Vervaeke", "time": "37:26", "text": "The problem with the term ego is we think it's a it has a single reference, but it's actually equivocal. It points to many different things. Same with the term self, and self and ego overlap in in strange and confused and befuddling ways. So we have to be sort of really, really careful and try to pull a bunch of things apart. I'm going to use the word self to be the organization of your cognition that gives you agency, that gives you your ability. So what's an agent? An agent is different from a behavior, everything behaves, everything generates behavior, right? An agent, this isn't a comprehensive definition because what an agent is a philosophically profound problem. But here's at least an important idea, an agent, unlike mere behaviors, an agent can in some sense, determine the consequences of its behavior and alter its behavior to try and alter the consequences. So in some senses, agents, can they be therefore understood as problem solvers? This glass is not solving any problems, although it behaves in a lot of ways. Is that okay? So what I'm calling yourself is the structural, functional, organization of your embodied cognitive processes. That doesn't just doesn't just mean thoughts in your head, it means the skills you exercise, right? The states of consciousness that are available to you. So you have a structural functional organization of that machinery that makes you an agent. What it fundamentally is doing, I think, is what I was mentioning earlier. It's controlling at many levels in a highly complex and dynamically self organizing fashion, relevance realization, how you realize what's relevant. So you're doing it right now. You've got a whole topography of how things are salient to you, what's for grounded, what's background, you're assuming an identity, you're assigning a bunch of identities. You're doing all of this stuff, and you're doing it like that. And so you can't do without that. Because if you did without that, you would just face a nightmare. Worse than anything that that Cronenberg has ever produced. You'd be facing a nightmare of a combinatorial explosion of information in all directions. You would have no sense of your place or role or relevance to all that. You would be as you would be dissolved in terror. You don't want that. And I don't think that's enlightenment. [all laugh] So, the idea that we should, that we can sort of fundamentally dissolve that machinery away, I think it's a mistake."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "39:48", "text": "Dr. Vervaeke points to flow state and helping to dissolve the ego.

It's it seems to be universally available. There doesn't seem to be across you know, gender, across socioeconomic status, language use, historical context, everything. People can get into the flow state. Maybe you've had this. This is where you feel like really at one with what you're doing, like it's a weird state because, you know, metabolically, you're exerting a lot of effort, but it feels effortless. It feels graceful. You feels really at one with everything. The world seems very salient, super salient and alive. People get into this like an athletics or jazz or martial arts or poetry or video gaming. Okay, so you get in the zone, right? The flow state. Now, nobody knows what people reliably report in the flow state. They don't report that their agency is gone. Because of their agency was gone, that would be a disaster. But what happens in the flow state is that narrative, image management, self referential thing that we could call yout ego, that drops away. And here's the thing, here's the way in which it has been bullshitting you for your entire life. Because what it keeps saying is, I'm absolutely necessary to your agency.

You know, when you have like an aha moment, you can think of flow like just an extended aha moment, right? And so, and then, and then you get awakening experiences, and then you get enlightenment. The point is, all of that machinery. So in the sense that you just had of how you can lose that narrative, image managing, status craving thing in your head, and get your agency enhanced in flow. Imagine if you could extend that even more and more and more. That I think is what happens when people have awakening experiences, mystical experiences. And then if that enhanced agency and the reduction of the bullshitting of the narrative ego drops away, is directed towards ameliorating these perennial problems of self deception in a comprehensive and systematic way, that's how I think we should understand enlightenment. Instead of just trying to just find enlightenment phenomenologically and build all this mystique around it, let's reverse engineer it, we need to solve these perennial problems of self deception. We need to we need to have we need systematic and reliable ways to address that and to enhance meaning in life."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "42:33", "text": "Can flow state help us transcend our consciousness deeper and deeper and a way to reach enlightenment? Is there an end to flow state?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. John Vervaeke", "time": "42:41", "text": "And thank you give me a perfect segue so that I can shamelessly promote my next book. So the idea of the cognitive continuum. So let me quickly explain this notion of exaptation. This is Michael Anderson's work. I think it's some of the best work, and the impact it's going to make on our ideas about brain functioning and brain development, I think I'm going to be profound and pervasive. But basically what he argues, so let's do a, let's get quickly what it is biologically. So exaptation is during speciations, right? The modification of the morphology of a creature by through processes like natural selection. What you do is evolution doesn't have to sort of make I'm going to use design in quotation marks, because there's no intelligent agency behind evolution, that language is agentic. So please forgive me. But evolution doesn't have to design from scratch. So notice, I'm using my tongue to speak right now. Right? Lots of creachers have tongues, and they don't talk. So tongues didn't originally evolved for speaking, they evolved for sensing poison, and for moving food around. And for weird evolutionary reasons, our tongues happen to be also in our air pathways, right? And so this machine is highly flexible, highly sensitive, and can interrupt the flow of air in really significant ways. So it's a great machine to use for talking. So Evolution doesn't have to make a speaking machine from scratch, it can exact the tongue. That doesn't mean you lose the tongue's function right? Now, what you can think of as you can think that, what our brains are doing, right? It's that they're exacting, they're taking things that sort of self organized for doing one set of problems, and then they get exacted for other things. The flow state is when you exact the insight machinery into something more comprehensive. But that machinery that flow machinery can be exacted up into mystical experience, where the dissolution of that narrative ego becomes profound. And the sense of at one becomes comprehensive, and you feel profoundly at one with everything. That can go even deeper that can be exacted into what's called an awakening experience. So, if the experience goes very deep, it can get into the depths of that machinery I was talking about, that machinery of the self. And remember, it's always not only the depth of the self, but it's the depth of the world that that you're connected to. So you, right? If the mystical experience goes deep into the machinery of the self, and deep into the machinery of how you understand the world, you can have an awakening experience. What happens is, and I studied this a lot is people get what are called higher states of consciousness, they get a sense of, see, most of our altered states of consciousness we dismiss. We say, that's a dream. Oh, that's not real. I was drunk, that's not real. But what's weird about these altered states of consciousness, these higher states that I'm about to describe, is people go into them and they say, that was more real than all of this. And then because we want, this is the meaning of life, because we want to be deeply connected to what is most real, what people will do is they will transform their identities and their lives to try and stay in closer contact, greater conformity, with the really real. I call this ontonormativity. The, this normative demand, we're called by what's most real. If in that transformation, they internalize a whole bunch and ecology of psycho technologies for addressing perennial problems of self deception and for enhancing, even beyond what you get in the flow state, that deep sense of connectedness, imagine people who had profound flowing insight and we're deeply connected in such a way that they are always in a fluid and creative manner, addressing perennial problems of self deception. And their relevance realization was superb. They come into any messy and complex situation and way better than you or I, they can zero in on the relevant information and adapt their agency to it. Wouldn't that be a wise person would not be a very wise person. That's what I mean by enlightenment."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "46:46", "text": "In one of Dr. Vervaeke's recent publications, he makes an interesting argument that the zombie which is a modern day myth is a symbol of the meaning crisis.

This also points to that they're locked into a, an empty mode of consumption, and their consumption doesn't feed them. It doesn't nourish them, right? Because they're not actually sort of alive. Right? They're the only communal monster, they move around in hoards, but there's no communitas, there's no connection. There's no shared culture, and they don't have a home. They don't have a lair. They don't have a castle. They don't have they don't have any of that stuff. They don't have a place they haunt, right? They don't have a home, they're homeless, they drift.

Everything about us has decayed, and become ugly, and lost contact, lost meaning, and lost direction, and lost purpose, and lost community, lost history, all of that's gone in the zombie. The zombie isn't even particularly threatening on its own, the zombie.

This is the mythological, and I don't mean this as an insult, I use this I don't use this term pejoratively, I think the zombie is a perversion of the myth of the Christian resurrection. So Christianity created this pathway for cultivating wisdom and self transcendence. And its ultimate mythological representation for that was the resurrection as exemplified in Christ, and we could imitate him and participate. Notice how we end up imitating the zombies but only through infection and degradation, and the end the way the zombie comes back is not, right, a life. It's not. It's not the life the abundant life that Christ promised. And notice that also that the zombie has magnetized and connected to another myth, the apocalypse, which is also originally a Christian idea. And so the apocalypse is like remember we talked about insight the apocalypse originally met revelation. It's like an insight restructuring of the entire world. Jesus returns and the world the old world ends, but like in the sense like when you're trapped in a problem, and your old way of looking at the problem ends, and a new way of seeing reality like in an insight. So you imagine like an insight that was spread over the whole world and transformed at all. That's the apocalypse. That's revelation. But the zombie apocalypse doesn't do that, the zombie apocalypse doesn't reveal or disclose a new way of understanding ourselves or reality. In fact, it is, in fact, it does the opposite. The zombie apocalypse brings no narrative closure. There's no finality. There is no solution. There's just a pervasive sense of the spreading of the despair, and the degradation. So the zombies, I think, in many ways prevert, undermine, right, all of the meaning making machinery and some of our deepest and most profound mythological symbols for the cultivation of wisdom, transformation of meaning.

Just an empty, absurd, wanting people to look at him and pay attention to them. Right? And so that absurdity of narcissism, that's why narcissism is growing and pervasive in our culture because it's sort of a last ditch defense and a very degraded one, of our relevance making machinery. And so what does the narcissist do? Their position is ultimately absurd. So what they do is they violently try to bring about as much chaos and absurdity around them. So at least their narcissism is at least in that weird perverted way, is legitimated because at least then everything is absurd.

You should take up a mindfulness meditative practice. And then you should also take up some kind of mindfulness contemplated practice, you should definitely have a movement practice like tai chi chuan, especially a movement practice that gets you more in touch with, a better taste for, getting into the flow state and a much more comprehensive fashion. You need to take up practices of active open mindedness. Here's a practice I do. I begin the day by reviewing some of the scientific research on various cognitive biases, like the confirmation bias, whatever, right? And then what I do throughout the day is I try to notice instances where I am engaging in that bias and then I try to actively counteract it. And then at the end of day, I write in a journal about, you know, where I was falling prey to the bias and maybe I didn't catch it, or where I did catch it, when I got into the flow state, when it went the opposite, so you really sensitize yourself with active open mindedness, getting into the flow state. You want to take up a practice of Philia and Sophia, you want to read, not so much a lot of modern academic philosophy, although there's good stuff out there, but I would recommend getting in touch with one of the ancient philosophical schools and getting into the literature. Don't just don't fall prey to sort of Orientalism and it's only the eastern thing. Only in the east is there wisdom, and all that kind of bullshit, right? Definitely take a look at Buddhist practices and Daoist practices, but also look at, you know, look at your own wisdom traditions, read Hadot's book, What is Ancient Philosophy or Philosophy as a Way of Life. Make sure at least one of your practices is socially organized, that you're putting yourself in touch with the collective intelligence of distributed cognition. Culture is our big adaptation.

This is how we build ourselves. All, most of us have experienced, snippets of flow. So what I would suggest is that when it's winter, when there's less light, let's have our clients, our students, our other individuals in different sectors tap on to their creativity. Because you you can be creative in many avenues, and creativity can engage you. If possible I asked them to explore their strengths and explore their strengths from multiple perspectives. So it's a bit of a technical way. Then they do a bit of a test which involves least amount of words. Then one is about language and then online self report, validated measure, but more importantly, I ask students and my clients to request to people to identify their strengths. Not crank them, but just identify the top five, four or five strengths, and then put out all the profile together. And even if creativity is low, but they are, there are other strengths which are high, for example, if grit is high, perseverance is high, curiosity is high, appreciation of beauty is high. How can you use these strengths towards creative endeavors? So even a boring task such as writing a term paper, how can you infuse more curiosity in it? How can you bring the element of something of love of learning, something that you did not know? How can you bring into that? So I think we also need to demystify creativity from the high pedestal of you know, the easel and the painting and the performing arts. That creativity every day, creativity which uses, which taps many other assets and abilities. So that's one way. Secondly, I would say another important aspect in positive psychology is relationships and connecting. I sort of, so demystify the relationship in the sense that there is no perfect relationships. All relationships are, or have some pluses and minuses. So if we can gently train our mind, our attention to spot the positives, that can foster closer relationships. Not perfect again, we're not going for perfection.

While this exclusion is well intentioned, we need pediatric research to answer important clinical questions and improve clinical care for this patient population. On this episode of Raw Talk, we explored the nuances of pediatric health research and clinical practice. Our conversation started with Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson, Staff Cardiologist, researcher, and Chair of the Research Ethics Board at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), who shares why it's so important to include vulnerable populations, like children, in research and the ethical considerations that make this possible. Dr. Stephenson also discussed concepts including capacity, consent vs assent, and risk vs benefit in the pediatric setting. We also spoke with Nurse Practitioner Tara McKeown and Clinical Research Nurse Andrea Cote about their exciting and challenging roles in the New Agent and Innovative Therapy (NAIT) program, conducting early phase clinical trials at SickKids. Finally, Dr. Paul Nathan, Director of the AfterCare childhood cancer survivorship program at SickKids, shares how clinical care differs in childhood vs adult cancer survivors, the concept of \"shared care\" in this field, and both he and Dr. Stephenson discuss the importance of including children and adolescents in conversations about their health.", "authors": ["Melissa Galati"], "prod_team": [], "tags": [], "links": [{"title": "Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario", "href": "https://www.pogo.ca/"}, {"title": "All Ontario AfterCare Programs - POGO", "href": "https://www.pogo.ca/programs-support/survivor-care/pogo-aftercare-program/"}, {"title": "SickKids AfterCare Program", "href": "http://www.sickkids.ca/HaematologyOncology/What-We-Do/Patient-Services/Programs/index.html"}, {"title": "New Agent and Innovative Therapy (NAIT) Program", "href": "http://www.sickkids.ca/HaematologyOncology/nait/index.html"}, {"title": "Children's Oncology Group (COG)", "href": "https://www.childrensoncologygroup.org/"}, {"title": "Ronald McDonald House Toronto", "href": "https://www.rmhctoronto.ca/"}], "transcripts": [{"speaker": "Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson", "time": "0:00", "text": "There are historical differences with regard to protectionism of children.

And so for another person, even a parent to accept risk on behalf of a child is a complicated concept. And so that's been an issue and for a long time, it was forbidden to do research on children. The problem with that is it's introduced bias, where we actually don't have good ways to treat children for a lot of diseases because we're explicitly forbidden to test things on them."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "0:44", "text": "As you may have already guessed, we're diving into medical research in the pediatric setting on today's episode, you just heard from Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson.

What factors do you think have contributed to this? And does the lack of pediatric medical research make evidence based medicine particularly challenging in this population?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson", "time": "3:17", "text": "In much of pediatric medicine, we're extrapolating from the adult literature, whether it's in observational studies, you know, randomized trials, there's almost never the depth of information in the pediatric world, simply because kids are usually healthy, which is good. And so for a long time, doing drug trials in children was exceedingly difficult. But there is a real awareness of this now. And I think a move towards making sure that we're promoting safe ethical research in all populations, pregnant women is another population that sort of famously underserved by research, because people are terrified as to what the effects might be on the fetus. So I think both of those there's a real move to include those populations in research in a safe way. The solution to vulnerable subjects is to protect them within the research not to exclude them from the research."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "4:15", "text": "In many ways, it is understandable that we would want to protect children.

For justice to be met, individuals within a population must have equitable access to the potential benefits of research or of a given intervention that might be under study. For this to be achieved, they have to share and the potential risks. Would you say that the past exclusion of children from research studies in many areas might be unjust and thus challenging from an ethical standpoint?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson", "time": "4:55", "text": "It's hard to make a sweeping statement like that because I think that there Are some studies where children would be appropriately excluded and others where they're inappropriately excluded. I think the principle that you mentioned, of justice is exactly the right thing to think about. So are you excluding children, because they are at higher risk from the research and thus they would have an undue burden of risk. And then it might be just to exclude them. But you have to recognize that in and excluding them, you also exclude them from all of the benefits both the knowledge gained and the potential access to the experimental therapies. So I wouldn't want to make a sweeping statement about it, because I think it does very much depend on the research. But certainly, the tendency to not allow things to be tested in children is not just"}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "5:47", "text": "Is research generally performed in adults first, then children?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson", "time": "5:51", "text": "Typically, if there is a biological equivalent of the disease that's being studied. Typically, it will be studied first. in adults, there are certainly circumstances where that's not feasible diseases that manifest differently in children or in their most severe form in children, or your best chance at intervening is at presentation. And so in those circumstances, you may go directly to the pediatric population, to have your best information and your best chance of the research actually benefiting children. One of the things that we know is that diseases that typically express themselves in adulthood, but occasionally present in childhood can be very different in their childhood version. So if I look into my world of cardiac electrophysiology, there's a disease called Brugada syndrome that's caused by abnormalities in the SCN5A gene and the presentation in adults is very different from the presentation that we see in the youngest children. And so although we can learn and extrapolate from both populations, if you look solely at one or the other, you will not get a complete picture of the disease, and ultimately, probably of your therapy."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "7:18", "text": "More of a general question, what makes a research study ethical?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson", "time": "7:22", "text": "A general question and an incredibly complicated one, informed consent is essential. And that can be provided by the participants, it could be provided by a substitute decision maker, or, in some circumstances, it can be provided in the form of a waiver of consent, which the REB can provide for a study that's thought to be significantly lower risk to the individual participants. We look for a sense of fairness or justice, we need to be actually scientifically sound. So for example, we would not consider a study that looked at the ability to telepathically influence the people in three countries away and likely to be scientifically sound and so it's a waste of everyone's time, at best, we would consider that not ethical. We look for evidence that is going to be something that is actually feasible and can be carried out when we consider people's budgets, do you have enough money to recruit the patients and do the science that you've said you're going to do? Because if the participants give you their time, energy, saliva, blood samples, whatever it is, and you get halfway down the road, and you run out of money, and it all goes kaput, you know, that is not an ethical research project. Those are the big principles."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "8:51", "text": "What say does a child generally have in agreeing to participate in research or to undergo a particular medical procedure versus a legal guardian?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson", "time": "9:00", "text": "It's a great question. It's something that we spend a lot of time thinking about. So whenever a child who doesn't have the capacity to consent for themselves, is asked to participate in research, we do look to obtain assent."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "9:14", "text": "Just sort of what is capacity, for our listeners?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson", "time": "9:16", "text": "Yes. So capacity is the ability to understand what you're being asked. So, capacity is very subject dependent. It may be that there are decisions that very young children can make in terms of the capacity. Do you want vanilla ice cream, or do you want chocolate ice cream? Most children have the capacity to make that decision. They know what the ice creams are, they know which one they like better and they know what they're asking for. On the other hand, trying to decide whether or not to participate in a randomized trial of two cardiac interventions, most young children will not have the capacity to understand it's complex. There's a lot of implications both directly in terms of what the experience might be like for the child, but also the potential health risks and benefits. So those are complex things to understand, it's something that we would typically not expect a five year old, seven year old, maybe an 11 year old, the older you get, the more capacity you have in a typically developing child and so with that, the ability to consent for oneself grows with age. We're very lucky in Ontario that we do not have, from a medical perspective, a discrete age of consent. And that means that we can make that decision with the family and with the child on an individual basis. There are lots and lots of 16 year olds who have full capacity to make health decisions. And there are lots and lots of 16 year olds who have no concept of their own mortality, and do not have that. So it's something that we really need to assess for every participant."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "11:02", "text": "So I guess the say that the child has differs, depending on age and other practitioner to patient consideration. So it's very case by case?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson", "time": "11:11", "text": "Yeah, absolutely. And I think that there, there are circumstances under which we would not respect a child's assent or dissent. So if the medical research that was going on was also a mechanism to deliver a therapy. So for example, a new medication that is expected to be the best therapy available to the child, just as we wouldn't allow that child clinically, to refuse the medicine, we won't allow them to refuse it within the structure of the research trial, we would, however, still want to respect their dissent for things that were not directly related to their benefit. So for example, if somebody is in this medication trial, where we really do think that this is the best thing for the child, but there's an MRI, that's an optional assessment, and the child is very claustrophobic, we should allow them to dissent and refuse to participate in the MRI even while we're saying no, you need to take your medicine, you need to be part of this, because we think it's the best thing for you. Sometimes that MRI is essential, because it's going to provide you fundamental safety information to protect the child. And then again, it flips back to the category of saying this is in the best interest of the of the child. And we're gonna make it as easy as we possibly can on them, but we're not actually going to allow them to say no."}, {"speaker": "Biren Dave", "time": "12:38", "text": "Now we have an idea of how consent works in the research setting when working with pediatric populations but how does it work in a clinical setting? How do clinicians go about communicating complicated diagnoses and treatments to young patients? We asked Dr. Paul Nathan, a pediatric oncologist at the Hospital for Sick Children. You will hear more from Dr. Nathan and his role as the director of the AfterCare program for childhood cancer survivors later on in this episode."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Paul Nathan", "time": "13:03", "text": "Right. So yeah, I mean, certainly, you are faced sometimes with having complex diagnoses or poor prognosis that you need to discuss with, obviously, with families, but also with kids. And obviously, the sort of developmental age stage and maturity of the kid really influences how you do that. Certainly, when you're dealing with older kids and teenagers, you make an assessment of both their maturity and also their capacity, right, because in Ontario, there's no age of consent. If you can fully understand the disease and its implications and the risks and benefits of therapy, then in Ontario, you're considered to be a competent, I guess, adult for the purposes of making decisions. There's no age of consent. So things like getting surgery or starting chemotherapy if you're 16, but fully cognizant of your disease and the risks of the treatment and the potential benefits of the treatment and the team makes the assessment that you're competent, the decision is actually yours or not your parents. And that may make for a good complete podcast around the ethics around that because there are places where there's an absolute age, you know, it's 18, below 18, your parents make choices above 18, you make choices. But clearly, there's teenagers less than 18, who are more than mature enough and intelligent enough to understand and make decisions. And there's 19 and 20 year olds who may still not be able to a point where they can make those decisions independently. So in the older teenagers, really, we're talking to the teenagers and obviously you as with any cancer patient, you talking to you you always are trying to couch it in language of hope, you know, hopefully, when as a new patient, there is a pathway to cure and the hope is really about how we're going to get you better. Sometimes kids have disease that's not curable and although we often start really trying to find a way to cure them, sometimes this becomes clear that that's not going to happen. And then those hopes sometimes change right to the importance of spending time with family, or the importance of not suffering from serious symptoms and those sorts of things. And we have conversations with these teenagers about these things. But as you can imagine, that's incredibly difficult. We have a whole team, you know, we've got social workers, we've got child life specialists, the whole family is part of that team. In younger kids, it's different, right? Because you can't really explain to a four year old what having cancer means, and they don't get to make decisions, which is often challenging, right? Because, you know, particularly when you're having, you know, nasty things being done to you, injections and procedures and stuff, and you have no control over it, that's very difficult as a toddler, for example. But we certainly try and explain what we're doing so that there's no surprises. So if they get to get a needle, we explain it, and we try and support them through it. But we try and use language that they can understand. I don't think a lot of four, five year olds can understand the idea of cancer and the fear that goes with it, but they can certainly understand being sick, being in hospital, needing different procedures, all of those sorts of things"}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "16:09", "text": "is the child's usually included in conversations that occur between researchers and or clinicians and their parents or other legal guardians."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson", "time": "16:16", "text": "It's highly dependent on what the study is. So just like for clinical informed consent, there are conversations that you may have with the child in the room and there are conversations that you may not have with the child in the room. When I'm discussing with a family possibly doing a cardiac ablation, some of the youngest children would get very frightened if they heard the details of how I access the heart and what I do. But the parents need to know that information. So sometimes the children choose not to be part of that discussion. On the other hand, some children want every single detail and that absolutely should be respected. And I think that is very similar for clinical and for research consent. Obviously, we're not offering clinical procedures unless we've already decided it's in the best interest of the child. So for research that the optional components need to be explored directly with the child particularly carefully in age appropriate language,"}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "17:21", "text": "It is clearly a tremendous challenge to determine what information a child has the maturity to fully comprehend and be comfortable with. This challenge must be balanced with the obvious need to ensure that children are given the best opportunity to assent to the research being performed on them. As researchers, we must be cognizant of these challenges as we seek to move pediatric medicine forward."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "17:42", "text": "On a more practical consideration than if in the large majority of cases we're not performing the early phase trials in in a pediatric setting, how are later dosages determined for drugs, in particular for kids, if we're only testing it in adults?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson", "time": "17:59", "text": "Absolutely. So historically, that's actually been a huge problem because the big trials have been done in adults, they've gotten their regulatory approvals based on those trials. They've never done the same level of investigations in children with things like pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics and so the drugs may never get regulatory approval in the pediatric population. And so then pediatric clinicians are less to guesstimate and say, well, you know, it's half the size of an adult so, let's start with half the dose. We do that clinically all the time."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "18:36", "text": "As we enter into an age where more research is thankfully being performed directly in the pediatric setting, do there remain certain studies or kinds of studies where we might have to rely more so on adult literature given the challenge, ethical or otherwise, of performing the work in kids directly?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson", "time": "18:52", "text": "So what we look at when we're evaluating the research studies is really all around the risk benefit ratio. And for any research where there is unlikely to be direct benefit to the child who's involved, then, it's typically considered to be unacceptable for them to be exposed to anything greater than minimal risk. So when we talk about minimal risk, we're typically talking about access to data privacy concerns, sometimes, exposure to behavioral interventions can be minimal risk, although not always. And, for example, blood that's drawn at the same time as a clinical blood draw, so the child isn't experiencing any pain, but the blood sample is obtained. Those are often things that we would consider minimal risk and acceptable for a substitute decision maker to provide consent for and the child should of course, as such, they should agree to participate when it comes to research that's greater than minimal risk and does not offer potential benefit to the child or sometimes there community, then typically, that's not going to be acceptable. Obviously, there may be unusual circumstances where we would allow it but there tends to be an awful lot of conversation before we'd consider something like that."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "20:13", "text": "So can children not participate in research where there would be no direct benefit then?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson", "time": "20:17", "text": "So they can, but it needs to be minimal risk to the child. For example, as I spoke of the collection of blood at the same time as a clinical blood draw, that would typically be acceptable, anything using their their health data with adequate privacy protections in place is typically considered minimal risk, secondary use research. So there clinical data being taken and used in another way, it's typically minimal risk, there are a lot of things that we can allow for children without direct benefit. But when you move into the higher risk things, anything that involves an invasive procedure, administration of a medication, anything like that, then typically you need to have at least some potential benefit to the child."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "21:03", "text": "To determine the risks and potential benefits of new treatment options for children, researchers conduct studies called clinical trials. To learn more about what these types of studies entail, we went to Sickkids to speak with Tara McKeown, a nurse practitioner, and Andrea Cote, a nurse research coordinator, who are both heavily involved in clinical trials run at Sickkids. Tara and Andrea work within the Novel Agents and Innovative Therapy Program, or NAIT for short at Sickkids. NAIT was started in 1997, and has since grown to include many different types of health care professionals, and offer phase one and two clinical trials for children with various types of cancers. The NAIT program is one of a kind in Canada and we asked her and Andrea why such a program is needed,"}, {"speaker": "Andrea Cote", "time": "21:46", "text": "You're never going to try something new if you don't do clinical trials. So having new agents and innovative therapies always comes in the form of a clinical trial and being able to offer patients different options, you know, other options that aren't just the chemotherapy options when there are no other available treatments that we know work is so important, I think in the family's journey through cancer. And just in saying that we are always trying to be better, we're always trying to look for the newest and the best for these kids."}, {"speaker": "Tara McKeown", "time": "22:17", "text": "We've been pushed by the families, which is where we should be pushed from they they know when they go into these early phase clinical trials it's not generally speaking, it's not to find a cure, but they want to, they've gone through this and they want to be able to help future families and kids as well, too. And in order for any drug to eventually make its way up into the efficacy models, it would pass a phase three to know if that works and needs to start at phase one. So it's an exciting opportunity to be part of but it's also mostly driven and pushed by families, which is what we focus our careers on as well too."}, {"speaker": "Biren Dave", "time": "22:48", "text": "Clinical trials play an important role in finding new evidence based methods to treat illness. These trials are organized into three phases, in phase one, the safety of the new treatment is determined. Next in phase two, researchers assess how well the treatment works, or in other words, they're testing the efficacy of the treatment. If a particular treatment is found to be both safe and efficacious, then it can be tested on a much larger cohort of patients during phase three trials to more thoroughly understand its effectiveness. If the treatment passes all of these steps that can be approved for widespread use, one question we had is how are clinical trials and children different from those conducted in adults?"}, {"speaker": "Tara McKeown", "time": "23:27", "text": "Typically speaking, in historical trials, they started with low dose and increased up to higher dose to find kind of where the toxicity and where would be the most tolerable doses that what they look for. We normally start at normally very small clinical trials, in comparison to the adult world, which you might hear about, there's no first in human studies that are done in kids. All of these drugs have been used on humans so in adults to some capacity prior to them being used in kids. But we do know that kids are not just mini adults, we know that their metabolism is much different so hence the reason to have those phase one trials."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "24:02", "text": "Pediatric clinical trials also present unique challenges to both patients and their families. Some of these include accessibility, eligibility and consent."}, {"speaker": "Tara McKeown", "time": "24:11", "text": "So I think challenges would be so certainly for early phase clinical trials, distance from the site, because we're one of the few phase one sites across Canada. So certainly distance for families to travel here, if they're interested in early phase clinical trial. And having the children involved depending on their age, more often than not, they're not consenting to treatment, but they need to assent so they still need to agree to go about this treatment. So that can in itself, there could be some disagreements amongst the family or amongst the child as far as exactly what the family wants to do when embarking on this."}, {"speaker": "Andrea Cote", "time": "24:44", "text": "And I think speaking to that, it's the importance of taking the time to really have the conversation and to make sure that everybody's on board with the treatment before you proceed is essential."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Elizabeth Stephenson", "time": "24:56", "text": "I think that the the biggest challenges that are specific to pediatrics would come when parents really want a child to participate in a research trial that may or may not have direct benefit for them, and the child doesn't want to participate. So examples of these would be very early phase one research trial for a child that has lethal disease, the parents desperately hope that this trial might offer some benefit to the child. But realistically, the research is at too early of a stage that that's a true expectation to come out and children maybe don't want to go through it. That quandary is one that we face on occasion, and can be a really challenging conversation, because we do try to provide family centered care and support both the parents and the child through an experience like that. And there are not easy answers to that balance of allowing the parents every bit of hope that you can, while respecting the child's right to dissent."}, {"speaker": "Biren Dave", "time": "26:11", "text": "Another challenge is getting a child enrolled in a trial in the first place, this process isn't as easy as it may seem."}, {"speaker": "Andrea Cote", "time": "26:18", "text": "One of the hardest challenges with this is the eligibility. So there's often very strict criteria to even be eligible for these trials. And the first step of getting on a trial is doing screening tests and sometimes those tests may come back saying you know what, you're ineligible, your echo function isn't as good as we need it to be to join this trial, for example. And so I think one of our challenges is when we give families this hope, or this potential that there's a treatment option, and then when they don't meet the criteria, and they're not able to join the trial that can be very frustrating and disappointing for families."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "26:53", "text": "Along with eligibility, accessibility is another hurdle. Since SickKids is one of the only health care centers offering early phase pediatric clinical trials, it can be very difficult for families to make it there if they live far away. Imagine for a second that you're a parent living in Northern Ontario, and your child's physician has referred you to a clinical trial in Toronto. In addition to managing your child's illness, you'd have the added burden of uprooting your life, your family's life, and your child's life in order for your child to enroll in the trial."}, {"speaker": "Tara McKeown", "time": "27:24", "text": "What we struggle with what we talk about the most, especially since we're one of the largest phase one pediatric oncology centers in Canada is having equal access across not only within the province, but also across Canada as well, too. As we all know, Ontario is very big, so ensuring that it's equitable for all of our families, that continues to be a challenge. So getting those resources, so families, if they want to come here that we can actually make it feasible, and it's not going to be a financial, social burden on them. So just engaging all of the team players across Canada who worked on within pediatric oncology, along with the parents and families like they are a strong advocate for their for their kids, which is great. So being able to engage them to kind of increase funding, so it's actually economically feasible for them to make it happen to come here,"}, {"speaker": "Biren Dave", "time": "28:12", "text": "A family having to relocate across the country to come to Sickkids for a trial can be very difficult for them.

And, you know, we always try to if we get, you know, tickets to something or anything comes up to kind of offer it to make the experience a little bit better. But it certainly is a challenge for those families that are traveling to be away from their support systems, even extended family who might be helping with some of the care or just emotional support. If you're from a small town, being in the big city of Toronto can be overwhelming, and just navigating the subway, as much as it's part of our daily life here, sometimes not for other people and it can be really hard for them."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "29:12", "text": "The challenges don't stop once the child and their family get to Toronto to begin the clinical trial.

And never mind the fact depending on their recurrence with their disease, it could be credit aggressive that we actually need to make this happen in a matter of days from time to time. Other times we have more time depending if they've just had surgery, if they just had radiation. But all of the coordination and liaison especially when it comes from an out of center hospital is so crucial and Andrea spends timeless hours just communicating with the outside teams because of course we want all children in Canada to be able to have equal access to these drugs if the families choose to want to but it can be tricky sometimes."}, {"speaker": "Andrea Cote", "time": "29:54", "text": "And it often is like you just drop whatever you're doing and you have to just focus on that and get the kid here as fast as possible, and we're happy if we have two weeks to do all that, but sometimes it is like a matter of days or a week that we have to do all of that stuff and then start the drug.

But more often, now we're seeing that they're actually looking within the biology of the tumor. So it might be a really rare one-off pediatric cancer, but they might have this mutation within their tumor that is common across another group of cancers. I think we need to remember that pediatric cancers are all rare in general, there are some rare entities within there. But I think with this biological era of medicine, and targeted therapies, immunotherapy checkpoint and out all this exciting stuff, it's perhaps made it maybe not easy as the right word, but more inclusive for all types of tumors because we're looking actually at the biology of the tumor. It's not to say that we're going to have a drug that's going to fix or like target all of these tumors and cancers, but we're better than we were probably a decade or so ago."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "31:27", "text": "Although the molecular profiling of cancers may be helpful.

But the Leukemia world is now really looking specifically at all of the cytogenetics of every leukemia patient in order to be able to determine which kids are going to do really well. And can we get them less treatment because of that? And which ones, which ones do we have trouble treating and why is that so, there's certain markers that they can know up front, and in order to give them more therapy up front. And in brain tumors in some groups, we're starting to be able to do that as well, too. Because of numbers, we don't have as many clinical trials to be able to evaluate if that's happening. But we're starting to get there, we still have a long way to come. The trouble being is when in the case that we do a whole genetic sequence of a tumor. More often than not, we won't have a drug that's going to target a specific mutation. And even if we do, getting access to it is not always available. And even if we get access, we don't know if it's necessarily going to work."}, {"speaker": "Biren Dave", "time": "32:32", "text": "Tara and Andrea highlighted some of the challenges that come with running clinical trials for pediatric populations. To overcome some of these challenges, the NAIT program was started. However, clinical trials aren't the only area in which we need specialized forms of care when working with pediatric populations. Specialized care is also required for children who have completed their cancer treatment and are now survivors of childhood cancer. In order to care for the unique needs of childhood cancer survivors, the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario or POGO initiated the AfterCare program. We bring it back to Dr. Nathan, who is the director of this program at Sickkids."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Paul Nathan", "time": "33:08", "text": "So the AfterCare program was actually started by POGO, which is the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario. And POGO brings together the five provincial pediatric cancer center, so Sickkids in Toronto, and then London and Hamilton, and Kingston and Ottawa. And so, docs at POGO had noticed that as childhood cancer survival went up, and in the sort of 70s, into the 80s, there was this huge improvement in survival. There was a time, you know, five decades ago when most kids diagnosed with cancer died. And then over the subsequent decades, because of improvements in treatments, better supportive care, so we could deal with the toxicities of treatments, more and more kids became long term survivors. And so it became clear to the folks who were running POGO that we need to have some plan, what do you do once the treatment is done, but you know that a majority of these survivors will be loving with some or maybe several consequences of a treatment. So they built starting in the late 90s this network of survivor clinics."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "34:11", "text": "As you just mentioned, approximately 80% of pediatric cancer patients are becoming long term survivors. But care comes at the cost of inferior long term physical and mental health. So I wanted to ask you specifically about the long term effects or late effects of childhood cancer. What are some examples of late effects and specifically, what are some of the psychosocial implications of childhood cancer?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Paul Nathan", "time": "34:32", "text": "So late effects are any long term consequences that are results of your cancer treatment, sometimes they can come from the cancer itself. So for example, if you had a brain tumor that damaged surrounding brain or a bone tumor that caused damage to bone that couldn't be repaired, but most commonly when we think about it, it's the long term toxicities of the treatments we use. So the toxicity of chemotherapy or radiation or bone marrow transplantation that turned into to chronic health problems, many of these are physical. So the most common physical late effects we see are things like heart problems, developing new cancers, for example, as a result of radiation therapy that can cause cancers to grow but really any organ system can be involved. So we see kidney problems, lung problems, liver problems, these problems tend to be pretty specific to the kinds of treatments you had. So no two cancer survivors will get the exact same late effects if they get them, because they may have had slightly different treatments. There are also psychosocial impacts. So the experience of having cancer can impact things like schooling, sometimes some of our treatments can affect the ability to learn. So certainly when we use radiation to treat brain tumors, or some leukemias, it can have an impact on learning, that impact on learning can lead to school difficulties, or can impact you later on in life in terms of job potential, even relationships and marriage and those sorts of things. And then obviously, the trauma of the cancer. And perhaps the challenge with dealing with the physical side effects of therapy can have mental health effects as well. So we know that some survivors are at higher risk for issues like anxiety or depression, or post traumatic stress, different survivors are going to have different outcome, some will do great with very few problems, and some really struggle with late effects with their therapy."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "36:25", "text": "Okay, so in terms of all these late effects, do you know how they differ from adult cancer survivors?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Paul Nathan", "time": "36:31", "text": "So there are differences, some of the differences are a consequence of the fact that we're treating these kids at a really young age, when many of their organ systems are still developing or growing. And as a result, a lot of survivors of childhood cancer are like more susceptible to treatments that can damage organ function. So for example, the risks for developing heart problems or kidney problems may be higher in particularly children treated at a really young age, where you're at a time when they should still be growing and developing their organs but you've now sort of added these chemotherapy or radiation treatments that sort of damage that ability. So I think one of the things we see is that some of these late effects in children can be more significant or severe than they are in adults. And cancers are different between children and adults. Treatments are different so, some of the things that we see are just a consequence of the types of cancers. So for example, in women who have breast cancer therapy, they may have something called lymphedema, which is sort of swelling of the limbs as a result of the surgery and loss of lymph node drainage. It's not something we see commonly in kids. But for the most part, both children and adults can get late effects of therapy, there's huge overlap between the two. I think one of the things that's really important to remember in kids is if you cure a child of cancer when they're five or 10, for example, they hopefully have decades of life ahead of them, so that if they develop some serious side effect of therapy, their life will be impacted by that side effect of therapy for decades afterwards, whereas adults, particularly those treated later on in life, may not have that many life years left after their cancer. And so sort of the long term impact of some of these side effects, at least in terms of how long someone needs to live with them can be really, really different between children and adults."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "38:19", "text": "The structure of the AfterCare program is multidisciplinary. You can think of it like a one stop shop for the healthcare needs of childhood cancer survivors. Many different types of health care professionals comprise the AfterCare team, including pediatric oncologists, nurse practitioners, clinical and neuro psychologists and endocrinologists. The team aims to address as many needs of the patients as possible during their visit without overburdening them with appointments. In addition to addressing and managing late effects of cancer, the program aims to take a preventative approach to health care by providing appropriate surveillance and lifestyle counseling to patients. But as many of the childhood cancer patients make it to adulthood, we wanted to ask Dr. Nathan, whether the transition from pediatric to adult survivorship care is a smooth one, do they tend to lose patience along the way?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Paul Nathan", "time": "39:06", "text": "So unfortunately, we do. So you know, when kids are kids, their parents are the ones who bring them certainly for their initial cancer therapy and then usually for the follow up and the truth of the matter is most parents are going to be really vigilant to make sure that their kid or teenager is coming for the yearly appointment. So at least in the pediatric years, almost every kid whose sense the survivor program shows up what happens at the time of transition when they now reach 18 and get transferred into the adult program. Several things one, the survivor has become far more responsible for their own health care. Their parents are starting to sort of play less of a role and suddenly they can't pick them up by their ear and drag them in. They may try but they can't force them to go. Often ,life intervenes, you know, they go off to university they get a job, they get married and have kids. And obviously, all of these things are competing pressures. You know, when you've got a kid newly diagnosed with cancer, you would drive to the ends of the earth to make sure they get care. But now you're 20 years old or, 25 years from that initial cancer, you feel entirely well. In many cases, you know, particularly if you were treated when you were really young, you may not remember much of your cancer. And so this idea of going to one of these five senses, which are often quite far, given sort of the geographic distribution of where people live in Ontario, that becomes a hassle. And unfortunately, for a lot of survivors, they don't come. So we've looked at attendance in the adult clinics, and maybe only about 40 to 45% of eligible survivors go even once. And when we track them over time, a lot of them drop out over time. And so one of the realizations that we have had in progress head of the last several years, is that this one size fits all, if we build a survivor clinic, everyone's going to show up model does not work. Certainly there are people who will continue to come to these clinics, you know, particularly those that have significant long term side effects with a therapy who perhaps feel that they can only get the kind of complex care they need. In a specialized program, maybe those that live closer, we've certainly found when we looked at who comes the further you live, the less likely you were to come. But for those patients live further away, or for those patients who at the moment feel quite healthy, this idea of coming downtown to a cancer center like Princess Margaret, maybe spending half a day, you know, getting there and waiting to be seen for a lot of them, that doesn't make sense. One of the challenges we have is that a lot of these late toxicities are not the kinds of things that appear right away. So you can have your cancer therapy and for years, even decades, you may be totally fine. But then sometime it's in your 30s or 40s, you start to develop heart problems because of the chemotherapy you got, or a new cancer comes up because you've got radiation for your original cancer. And so even feeling well doesn't necessarily mean that nothing's going to happen over time. And so there are lost opportunities if these patients aren't coming back to the specialized clinics. So what we've really started to do the last little while is think can we build sort of a parallel model of primary care docs in the communities who are closer to where these patients live, who would be willing to take on survivors. And so there's actually an initiative now, where we're reaching out to Family Health teams, or academic family medicine residency programs, to ask if they would be willing to take on adult survivors in the hopes that they'll build some critical mass. And that would make it worth their while to actually learn about these patients. Because one of the challenges with family docs are childhood cancer survivors are still really rare, fortunately, because cancer is rare in kids. And so most family docs maybe have one or two at most childhood cancer survivors in their practice, that doesn't give them much time to learn about their specific issues. And if you've got a brain tumor surviving the kidney tumor survivor, their long term problems can be entirely different. And if you're a family doc who's got diabetes, and dementia and heart failure, and all these adult problems in your clinic, when are you going to take the time to learn about these specific survivors and their issues. And so trying to identify some family health teams who've said this and will take on 10 or 20 survivors, it makes it worth our while to develop an expertise. And importantly, they know that the specialized clinics are there if they need help. So if they've got a patient and they worried, oh, you know, we found a new lump or a bump or we're not sure what's going on, we're all just a phone call away. So this model is called shared care, and so there's this push towards this shared care approach, as opposed to this one size fits all in the teaching hospital academic centers, which we don't think works."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "43:45", "text": "Dr. Nathan just discussed how the shared care approach benefits survivors who may have lost touch with specialized survivorship care programs. We also asked him how the transition works for pediatric patients who are continuously receiving AfterCare and then need to be transferred to adult aftercare at Princess Margaret Hospital."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Paul Nathan", "time": "44:04", "text": "Eventually, everyone needs to be transferred. Now in Toronto, you'll just be transferred to the Princess Margaret program. And we actually have a nurse practitioner who works in both the pediatric side and the adult side. So there's, at least this concept, there's this link, there's this continuity. And over the last five years or so we've also built in a transition program. So once a quarter, so every three months, we have a special clinic where everyone who's 17/18 coming for the last visit at the pediatric hospital who we know needs to go to the adult hospital, they come with their parents for a full day. The morning is sessions, where they're introduced the importance of survivorship, they actually get a tour of Princess Margaret so they know who the people are and what to expect. And then they're given what's called a survivor care plan, which is a document that basically says, this is the cancer you had, these are the treatments you've got. These are your long term risks, and these are the things you need to do to keep an eye on your health, like if you had chest radiation, start getting mammograms and MRI exams at a younger age than you would in the general population. So they're all given this right now, it's paper but ultimately, it'll be an electronic thing. That way, the hope is that if they don't show up at the adult clinic, but go see a family doc, somewhere in the community, they've got a document that says, hey, this is what I need. Because a lot of those family doc will not know. And so it's sort of our biggest job at this transition time point is to empower survivors to sort of take on responsibility for their own health and health care, because at the end of the day, the patient is the only one who can absolutely make sure they get what they need. And of course, you know, some do it really well, and others struggle, and it's how you help the ones that struggle that we struggle with."}, {"speaker": "Biren Dave", "time": "45:45", "text": "Earlier in the episode, we talked about incorporating children into the conversation about their health. However, Dr. Nathan mentioned, some interesting cases, where teenagers entering the AfterCare program, we're not aware that they had had cancer as children."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Paul Nathan", "time": "45:59", "text": "One of the interesting challenges that we actually have is, occasionally we'll have a teenager show up in our survivor clinic who doesn't know that they've had cancer, they will little when they had the cancer, so no one told them, or if someone told them, they didn't really understand what it means. And then for a variety of reasons, as they get older, either the parents, you know, decide, I don't want to tell them because I'm protecting them from this, or the parents are, this was so traumatic for me, as a parent, I can't possibly relive this by discussing it with my child. So often, it just never gets discussed and it becomes you know, when you were little you were in hospital, or when you were little, you had this little lump or bump. The problem is when they get to the survivor clinic, we make it very clear that they have to know because you can't teach someone to be their own advocates if they don't know they their health story. So then that cancer, how they ever as an adult can walk into a doctor's office and say, listen, when I was young, I had leukemia, these were the treatments I got. But sometimes there's actually a struggle with the parents to convince them that telling their kids is the right thing. And you know, it always fascinates us, because on the entrance to the clinic, it says The Sears Cancer Clinic, it's very clear what this place is. And I think we often wonder if these kids actually really know. And the reason they don't say it is because they're protecting their parents. So actually, right now, we're working with a group in the Department of Family Medicine, at Woman's College Hospital, creating a book, how to tell your child that they had cancer. So we're gonna interview with their help about 20 families who chose not to tell their child at the time they came into our clinic to understand sort of the varying reasons why that happened, sometimes it's a cultural thing. You know, in some cultures, cancer is a taboo, you know, and we've had some common, but we've had some patients with a family has not told their relatives that they have a child with cancer, because cancer is considered, you know, such a bad thing that there's almost a shame around it. And I think we even had a kid or to die without the extended family knowing what it was that they had died of, which is really disturbing and distressing. Anyway, so the booklet will, will try and both give rationales to why it's important to tell the kid but then also strategies as to how to do it. Because for parents, that's often a lot of reliving the trauma that was incredibly difficult the first time. So hopefully, that will be a useful tool."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "48:15", "text": "So one important aspect of your job is to advocate for the needs of the patient, or provide the patients and their family members with tools and information they need to advocate for themselves. And your hope is that the patients and the families will act on your clinical recommendations, but do you sometimes have parents that do not necessarily agree with your clinical recommendation for treatment?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Paul Nathan", "time": "48:37", "text": "It's incredibly hard. Sometimes it's for religious reasons, so the example used most often are Jehovah's witnesses who don't allow blood transfusions and that can be incredibly challenging, particularly in kids on therapies that push down their blood counts that potentially make them at risk without transfusions. And so the hospital actually has developed a whole policy and have actually worked with Jehovah's Witnesses to come up with a policy but there are certain circumstances in which if it was felt, that without blood transfusions, that kid would be at life threatening risk, there's a mechanism for the hospital taking over medical decision making around those sorts of things. So rarely, they can take the they can take that decision away from the parents. You know, there's other places where parents disagree, and you clearly feel like their disagreement is putting their child at significant risk and really, I think the only times that that would happen is when there's a treatment for a disease where the likelihood of cure is great. So for example, standard risk leukemia right now, the cures are more than 90%. If a parent of a young child, were to say, I don't agree with this therapy, it's toxic, you know, it's going to do harm etc. I want to go off to place XYZ for experimental treatment, whatever it is. There have been cases where the courts have had to get involved and at least the medical custody of that child is given over to like children's aid to make those sorts of decisions. Where it gets a lot greyer, I think is twofold, one, if that kid is older, so if the kid is a teenager who does understand the implications of not getting the therapy, but clearly is still under the sway of their parents, that can be a really difficult situation, it's not common, but it happens. And then I think the other place is if you've got a younger child who can't make decisions, but where the outcome is not guaranteed, so a disease where maybe the survival is 50% but the treatments are intensive with long term side effects. And the parents says I don't want that. Those are ones that everyone needs to wrestle with, right? Because to force legally a family to put their kid through treatment that has a high likelihood of not working and if it does work will have significant long term side effects, it's not so clear. So those you know, would sit down as a group would involve the ethics team and legal team. But there's times when we just, you know, we acquiesce to the parents decision, and hope things turn out okay. They don't always, but those can be hard situations, we deal with him on a case by case basis, I don't think you can have sort of a blanket every single time will will do this. But is it hard when we recommend what we think is the best thing and parents choose otherwise? Yeah, it is and it certainly happens."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "51:17", "text": "Yeah, that is quite unfortunate, and a difficult thing to deal with for sure. But I'm just wondering, on the other end, I'm sure you have families that put a lot of trust and faith in you. But when a treatment plan doesn't work out the way that you had hoped, how do you maintain that sense of trust with the family?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Paul Nathan", "time": "51:36", "text": "Yeah, you know, obviously, that can be challenging, particularly, I think, in a field like oncology, where unfortunately, things, you know, go wrong quite frequently. I think a lot of how you get through it has to do with the relationship you build with the families, sort of the openness and honesty, you try and introduce into a relationship from day one. You know, every cancer treatment starts with what we call a disclosure, which is, you know, once we know the diagnosis tumor x, or cancer y, we sit down with the family, usually for an hour, an hour and a half and we run through everything we explain the disease, what we know about it, we explain the treatment, we spend a lot of time talking about the potential risks and side effects so that they're fully aware there's no totally benign cancer treatments, all of them come with significant risk. And so as much as we hope that these bad things won't happen, we try and be sort of upfront and honest about it at the time they start therapy, and I often apologize to families, I say, this is a lot for you to listen to. But I'm not going to have your child start on this chemotherapy until you fully understand, you know what the risks are. So that if one of those bad things happens, you know, because you've discussed it before, and because it's anticipated, often they'll obviously be upset but it doesn't generally damage the trust that you've built, because it's a thing that you had sort of, you know, explained ahead of time, and they knew it was possible. They hoped it wouldn't happen, but you know, where it's difficult is if something happens, that's totally out of the blue that you never discussed or mentioned. And then it can impact trust, right? Why didn't you tell me this? If I'd known this was the potential toxicity, I would have never said, yes. That doesn't happen all that often. You know, one of the challenges we face sometimes, you know, your child gets cancer, who do you have to be angry at? Right? There's, there's no reason for it. You know, maybe if you spend your life smoking and drinking, and then later on in life, you do develop lung cancer, or something else that's really associated with that lifestyle. You can be upset and angry. But you also know that some of those lifestyle, be it choices or habits that just you couldn't break over the years accounted for it. But when your five year old gets leukemia, there's no one to blame, we don't understand why it happens but it's almost never something that the parents did or didn't do. And I will say, I start off my disclosure talks with parents to say the one thing I want you to know, is, there's nothing you did or didn't do either now, or when your kid was younger, even when your kid was stalled, you know, in the womb, that caused them to get this. We don't fully understand why kids get cancer, but choices are not a big part of it. So, you know, to feel to feel guilty about it is something that they really shouldn't do. Right. But it's, it's really, really hard."}, {"speaker": "Aditi Desai", "time": "54:36", "text": "Yeah, and the families probably appreciate the reassurance that you give them."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Paul Nathan", "time": "54:40", "text": "Right. But what happens sometimes sorry to finish off what I started is because there's really no one to blame, sometimes, not commonly, but sometimes the anger actually gets reflected back at us, because we are the face of oncology, right and so sometimes you need to let yourself within reason, be the person or the team to whom parents can direct their anger. Because short of screaming at the heavens, which, you know, doesn't always get a reply, there's no way to, to channel that, you know, extreme anger and sadness. And so sometimes that gets channeled at us. And, and so we've had some patients that have been difficult because we're parents, because they take out that anger on us. And you know, it's figuring out how much how much do you accept because it's part of their therapy? And where do you draw the line? Because clearly, some behavior is inappropriate, you know, you can't.

I lost custody of my daughter to my parents. And what I had done is I had succumbed to my lonely shame, shameful, and terrifying existence. I was doing self destructive behaviors in all areas of my life. During the last year, my substance abuse had turned to crack. I was a daily crack user, and I also was drinking three bottles of rubbing alcohol a day. And I worked the streets, during the day and at night to support my habit. I felt my mind was lost. I had repeated hospital admissions of rubbing alcohol poisoning over and over and over during that last year. I lost my apartment due to my drug addiction. And I moved into a room in a house and I had just a small room. And when my disease was at its worst, I got evicted from that home due to my alcoholism. And then I became homeless. I entered the shelter system. At that time, I felt insane, I felt deeply depressed, and I felt hopeless. The shelter was run actually by really caring staff, but they were on overload. And what would happen is you would get psychotic patients that would have psychotic episodes and, or you get violent patients and then the staff would have to, to run and serve these people and the rest of the house.

Oh, and remember the 23 others we don't see but on the verge of homelessness? Well their health is just as bad. Stunned by this data, I couldn't stop there. I wanted to know, how do the homeless die? Where do the homeless die? I was shocked by what I learned. The average life expectancy of the homeless? 34 to 47 years. The average Canadian? 77 to 82. The homeless die at a rate 2.3 to 4 times more than the general population. And while surveys show that most people want to die at home but only a fraction do, the data shows that this is so much worse for the homeless, dying in emergency rooms and hospitals. And then, in 2014, a report out of British Columbia confirmed the fact that homelessness cuts a person's lifespan by 50%. 50%. As a palliative care doctor who works in a hospital setting every day, I get the sense that I see people all the time with life-limiting illnesses like heart failure, liver disease, and cancer. But would be hard-pressed to name a diagnosis that predictively cuts a person's lifespan by 50%. So it got me thinking, is isn't homelessness a life-limiting disease? I mean considering the strength of the data, isn't homelessness a terminal diagnosis? It all comes down to a few crucial questions. What is a life worth? How do we value dignity at the end of life? Is it the same for everyone?"}, {"speaker": "Eryn Tong", "time": "12:35", "text": "Dr. Dosani is the founder and lead physician of a program called PEACH, or Palliative Education And Care for the Homeless, fostered by Inner City Health Associates.

So whether that be you know, in the street, in a shelter, in whatever housing that they do have, or who's ever couch that they might be living on. So PEACH started about five years ago, it just had its five year anniversary. And I wasn't there from the very beginning, but have been involved in some capacity for the last four years. And it started under the leadership of Dr. Naheed Dosani who's still involved in the program. And what he saw during his training was that there was this population who was really being excluded from mainstream palliative care, whose needs aren't being met. And in large part, those were individuals who are homeless and vulnerably housed. The full-time staff that we have is Sasha Hill who is our nurse and PEACH coordinator, and she does tons of the work for PEACH. So she's there on the frontlines every day being the first point of contact for a lot of our clients. She most recently, you know, had a bunch of donated equipment and she was out riding on the TTC with a commode for a patient. She helps navigate their care, oftentimes accompanies them to appointments, tries to address the social determinants of health, their income, their transportation. And she's, I think, one of the strongest parts of our program and what really makes us different from a lot of other you know, palliative care services who don't necessarily have that sort of care navigation that a lot of our clients really need to navigate the healthcare system. So we also have a very dedicated and wonderful palliative care coordinator who coordinates a number of the services that our clients need and often goes above and beyond her role to make sure that our clients get equitable services. There's also the nurses and the PSWs who care for our clients. So it's far beyond just nurses and doctors, but really, the communities that support these individuals, a lot of the people who work in some of the shelters and supportive housing units are very instrumental in making sure that those clients get to stay where they want to for the end of their life. And they often as well go above and beyond their roles to ensure that those individuals get their last wishes and die with dignity in a way that they would have wanted. And so it's really a community of people who are caring for clients within PEACH beyond just kind of the frontline clinical team."}, {"speaker": "Jillian Macklin", "time": "15:14", "text": "We asked Dr. Tedesco to walk us through how PEACH works."}, {"speaker": "Alissa Tedesco", "time": "15:18", "text": "We're a bit different in PEACH from mainstream palliative care services, in that we accept referrals from anyone, so that could be a friend, a family member, a shelter worker, a social worker, a physician, and so in that way, we try to be more accessible. And so oftentimes, we'll get a referral with what limited information that they do have, but these people, you know, they're worried about them, they think they might be dying. And they think they might benefit from having a team that can really provide trauma-informed approach that provides comprehensive palliative care. And so we'll get the referral, sometimes formally or informally, and then we do our best to meet the patient where they're at. So sometimes it's finding them in a park where they might frequent, it might be meeting them in the hospital before they're discharged, or it might be in the shelter where they're living, or in their own home."}, {"speaker": "Eryn Tong", "time": "16:03", "text": "Since PEACH began, there have been a number of other similar programs that have launched across Canada and in the United States.

It is Toronto's first hospice dedicated to providing end of life care for the homeless. Journey Home Hospice is a joint partnership between Hospice Toronto, Saint Elizabeth Foundation, and Inner City Health Associates. We asked Dr. Tedesco what challenges she faces as a physician working so closely with people facing structural vulnerabilities at the end of life."}, {"speaker": "Alissa Tedesco", "time": "16:34", "text": "I think just the frustration that you get with our health and social service systems, not being able to meet their needs. So we all work within the systems that we know oppress people. And so participating in those systems and not being able to provide the services and the care that you'd like to is very frustrating. From a palliative care perspective, a lot of people want to die in the place where they live and where the people who they care about are around them. And, you know, our government is only able to provide so much care. Community resources, and community agencies are often at a maximum. You can't get people to appointments when you want to, you know, other services don't always do a great job of collaborating with the community and the people that work with them in the community to kind of get them safely home and to provide a comprehensive plan that actually would work for that patient. And so I could go on a long time, about you know, kind of all the ways that our healthcare systems and social service systems, fail people but working in those confines is definitely frustrating, just as the person who's providing care and I'm not even the person who you know, is dealing with that myself. I'd say some other issues is just like the stigma that our patients face. So you know, from a palliative care perspective, a lot of them are excluded from mainstream palliative care services. And a lot of that has to do with, you know, behavior. They're labelled as \"having behaviors,\" and that might be, you know, from their mental health disorder or from their substance use disorders and because of that, they're excluded. They're deemed high risk. And often that risk is very individual and sometimes not based on the person in front of you, and it can be oftentimes based in stigma. And so that's very frustrating to try to- you know, there are services there and then you try to advocate for your patients, and sometimes they're just not the appropriate services. They don't use harm reduction. They don't use a trauma-informed approach. So finding them appropriate services can be a challenge as well too"}, {"speaker": "Zeynep Kahramanoglu", "time": "18:24", "text": "The challenges of finding appropriate services and the coordination and continuation of care that Dr. Tedesco highlights is certainly one that resonated with Linda's story.

They didn't know what to do with me after I graduated because I was homeless, and I wasn't able to go back to the shelter I was in. So they put me back in the detox. So I sat back in the detox and waited. What I was told to do is find shelter. They don't have people that look for housing for you, you have to look for housing for yourself.

Always thinking, I'm going to end up on the streets one of these days. And there you have 11 months to live. And I stayed there for seven months. I was looking for housing while at Harbour Light, and I found the housing workers around the city. I had gone, and it was a relentless search, looking for housing. There was one housing place I went to and I actually had to beg the lady to do something. I said, would you please look up something for me? Like I'm going to be homeless, like on the street in a couple of months, and I need you to help me, and she finally agreed to one spot but she didn't want to do anymore. But I did find Habitat for Humanity. They phoned and they had a spot at a rooming house, which I would share a room with somebody. And the rooming house is for women with mental illnesses, was how it was laid out to me. And I do have mental illness, so I know I qualified to be there. Because at the end of Harbour Light, I was getting really scared, and I was always living in fear, and actually what I did do is I did obtain a sleeping bag and I did get prepared. I got supplies to be ready to live on the street because I thought that's where I was going to end up. I just thought I either take this rooming house or I'm going to the streets, so I might as well get ready. And I do feel that when I was looking for housing, I got this label as \"homeless\" on me. And right away, I got categorized as there is something wrong with me, as a person, and then when I told them I was an addict, it was like, then I became a bad person and that I was homeless. I thought they felt as though I deserve to be this was something I had done to myself, was the feeling that I always got. And I found that it was a real dangerous combination for me to be stuck in.

And all the adversity I've had in my life. It's amazing that I can still smile and participate and actually be an advocate for change around poverty, homelessness, and just making sure that people are taken care of. I'll start with, which is sort of painful to talk about, is we're immigrants from Germany and we immigrated in 1967. I had a very abusive stepfather, which, you know, there were no shelters for women. My mother was beaten and I was beaten. He was an alcoholic. And it was very stressful for me because I didn't have really a chance to grow up from six years old. I had to maintain a household take care of my siblings, there were five. And I ended up leaving at 16 because my stepfather took me out of school, but he said, you know what, go get a job, see what life is all about. I had no, I loved school, it was my safe place. And I was doing well, even with my English handicap. So I got a job as a receptionist, at an optical company, and he actually took all my money, I didn't mind giving money to help support the family. But we didn't eat better. We still weren't paying our rent. And that's when I decided to leave at 16, partially for my own safety. The sexual abuse, my mother didn't know about, and because my mother was beaten, I couldn't talk about it to her. And knew it wasn't right, but I let it happen because I was afraid of him. The worst thing is to see my mother bounced off walls and at 63, I still have nightmares around that. I came to Toronto. I wanted to get out of Kitchener because we're from Kitchener. And I had nothing. I left with a little suitcase and I had no home. Luckily I was young and pretty, people took me in. And I couch surfed for a number of years until I found my place of my own at 21. I then enrolled in school. I found this apartment. It was $125, a top floor at 463 Dovercourt. And I went to see a doctor because I had a hard time getting up. I had a hard time functioning. And the doctor without really asking me anything, had said to me, \"Oh I'd like you to sign yourself into LakeShore psychiatric ward.\" And I had aspirations to teach. I didn't want to have a psychiatric history. My boyfriend said, You know what, you're not crazy. You're not going to do that. And I'm really glad. Why, if somebody, if you were just given me a hug, or some kind of kindness or- I can just imagine if I would have done that I probably would have been medicated, Heaven knows where I would have ended up.

He picks up the phone, phones the pharmacy, and says, put it on my bill. And the kindness of that man, at that moment, was just immense. He's one of my angels. He's one of my angels. And Dr. Markens, and he was already like, I want to say, in his 70s, was very kind and then I, because I was in the community, I heard of all the kindnesses he did to other people in the community. And I just want to say that a doctor that really cares can make a whole difference in your life. That man looked after me for 20 years, and was a saint. He always had a joke for me. And he was very kind. And I needed that. I really really needed that and I admired him and how much that meant to me that a person really cares. The difference a doctor can make in your life again, because I didn't even talk about Debbie Honnickman. Debbie Honnickman is my recent doctor that I have had for the last 20 years. When I went to see her, the first thing she asked me was, if I'd have been sexually abused. And I remember this, this wall of heat coming up, and I just said, I can't talk about it because I couldn't. But she then wrote down post-traumatic stress, which got me on ODSP because I was struggling on welfare. Even when I was going to school, I had $100 and you can't maintain health, nevermind i didn't eat well as a child, then try to move forward and not being able to eat well because you're paying rent, whatever. It's going to catch up with you. She had given me so many tools and how I needed that for my own healing, you know, to be able to move forward, and so I'm very late at 63, you know what I'm saying?

So that includes nurses, physicians, social workers, dietitians, amongst many others. And we're an alliance that was initially kind of based in Toronto but has since become more of a provincial network of healthcare providers. And since the inception in 2005, there's now two other chapters in Nova Scotia and in Newfoundland, as well there's small municipal chapters in Peterborough and Hamilton. So we've expanded quite a bit since the inception in 2005. HPAP's main goal is to reduce social and health inequities. As healthcare providers, our society allots us with a lot of power and privilege. And we are often very uniquely privileged to hear the stories of our patients and our clients and the struggles that they have facing, you know, structural determinants of health and the social determinants of health. And so for a lot of us, we see our roles having a lot of social accountability, and that our roles uniquely position us to be able to advocate alongside the patients that we see, and to speak to some of the injustices that we witness within our societies. So currently, some of our most recent work was around the federal election. So we kind of had two major projects that we did during the federal election. One was vote pop ups. And so this was done based on some of the work that's done at Ryerson and from Dr. Danyaal Raza back around the municipal election, but the goal of it was really to reach out to groups who aren't typically represented in the voting process or, or who face barriers to participating. And those are populations that are often very affected by the outcomes of elections. The other project that we did was a Federal Election Report Card, and we had done something similar for the provincial election. And for that project, we graded and looked at six kind of priority topics that we saw would have significant impacts on populations living in poverty. And we know that there are certain populations that are disproportionately affected by poverty. So those populations that are racialized, people who are Indigenous, for example. And so we looked at things like climate change, like access and affordability, employment income, Indigenous sovereignty, the overdose crisis, with a goal of just really educating voters about the multiple things that play into health and health outcomes. Right now, a lot of the work that we want to do is to build capacity in healthcare providers to engage in advocacy. I think a lot of- I mean I can speak to my experience as a medical student and a resident, you feel very motivated to engage in social justice work, but you don't necessarily know how to do it and I know that kind of is seen in other medical professions. And so giving people the tools and the confidence that they have to actually engage in this work I think it's something that we're kind of uniquely positioned to do and something that I'd like to work towards expanding into the future, to just go beyond teaching people about the social determinants of health but to having conversations about, you know, why are these these inequities and how can we, as healthcare providers, engage in advocacy at more like meso and macro levels? And I think as a health care provider who works with these populations, you can feel, sad and frustrated and angry, but I feel like when you're doing this more upstream work, it helps you to cope with some of those feelings and feel like you're actually doing something about it in a larger level, and not just kind of offering a band-aid solution. And so I'd advocate for people who you know, care about these issues and want to provide this care to these populations, and everyone really does in some way, to perhaps see that as a way to provide comprehensive care, to engage in advocacy at upstream levels for those populations beyond just the one-on-one individual clinical care."}, {"speaker": "Jillian Macklin", "time": "47:20", "text": "Tackling these issues at upstream levels for this population is in fact the focus of important research being done here in Toronto.

We have a long and torrid relationship with these mysterious compounds, many of which are found in nature and many more that we have now synthesized.

Drugs in this category include LSD, psilocybin, also known as magic mushrooms, TMT, and masculine. The next category is enpathogen and tactogens. These release serotonin in your brain, and include drugs such as MDMA, also known as ecstasy. The last group is the dissociative psychedelics. This group includes ketamine. Now, let's hear from Dr. Shorter about how some of these drugs were discovered."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Edward Shorter", "time": "5:35", "text": "Well, amphetamine synthesized initially in 1887. It was a very promising molecule. And it was clearly sympathomimetic, in addition to being highly psychoactive. And this is just too much of an opportunity for a clinical pharmacologist to resist. And Merck was a pioneering company in the area, clinical psychopath ecology. Its first director was a famous pharmacologist; Merck has always had a sterling scientific reputation among the biggest in the drug industry. Merck in really stand out for their commitment to fascinating science. And so it's not as at all surprised that they would take this molecule, the amphetamine PEA backbone, and start substituting it; substituting it means attaching various atoms to it to see what you can get out of it. So, all the amphetamines that we've talked about in our conversation had been substituted amphetamines. So that's what they were doing. They were substituting it with various atoms to see what worked in the clinic and what didn't work. This is the 1920s we're talking about, before clinical trials of any kind. Also, Merck itself doesn't do trials. It gives the drug to sympathetic doctors and request them to run the trial. That's what the medical director of a pharmaceutical company does. And they had some luck in the mood area. But, they didn't have a lot of luck. And people in 1920s, people weren't looking primarily at mood disorders. They were interested in dementia prey Cox, otherwise known as schizophrenia. And the amphetamines didn't have an impact at all on schizophrenia. So they really put these things on the shelf. And in the meantime, they became street drugs. So word got around that these were powerful psychedelics, although that term wasn't used in the 1920s. And they started this week careers. I mean, anybody can make MDMA; it's not a complicated molecule. And that's why ecstasy in the 1960s became basically the club drug of choice. It was easy to get hold of, powerfully hallucinogenic, and it didn't cost an arm and a leg."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Norm Farb", "time": "7:59", "text": "We need to start tightening the screws a little bit in terms of getting more objective of measures."}, {"speaker": "Amber Mullin", "time": "8:05", "text": "That was Dr. Norman farb, an associate professor of Psychology at the University of Toronto Mississauga, who studies mental habits and how they contribute or detract from well being. Dr. Farb is the director for the new psychedelic studies research program at UTM."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Norm Farb", "time": "8:20", "text": "Of course, you want to start with the subjective experience, like oh, there's a signal here like people are reporting there's a benefit, they're reporting something really meaningful, they're reporting, you know, I never smoked a cigarette again, I I realized like my all my life parties are wrong, and I'm gonna spend more time with family. You have these kind of things that would be reminiscent of all you would almost never see that in the natural life course, or people must suddenly had some kind of like natural disaster like a cancer diagnosis or like near death experience, something that really shook them up. So you see that signal there, and it's really compelling. But that's not enough to trade public policy on, right? And then on the flip side, you hear about people having bad trips and adverse events, and again, you wouldn't want to set policy based on a few anecdotes, because you have no idea what proportion of people that really represents. Yeah. So that's the goal, le'ts start moving towards a bit more objective clinical science and still honor that rich tradition of clinical reports, which is really what even motivates people to think this is a good idea. It's like, oh yeah, I have heard lots of people have these benefits. I wish we could really prove that's a thing. I think a common conception or misconception might be that, you know, this research is inherently going to be flaky, because it's based on these sort of, like far out man experiences. And I think something like microdosing, people aren't actually tripping, right, they're not, you know, breaking from reality. Even the participants don't have to get into those sort of states. And, you know, for our program at U of T, what we're really trying to do is follow the sort of emerging principles of open science: pre-register hypotheses, make data fully anonymized and transparent so other researchers can replicate our analyses, state our hypotheses and methods ahead of time, use well validated measures or if those measures don't exist, do the validation studies for ourselves. So I think the flakiness is a sort of built into people's like Shaggy from Scooby Doo conception of psychedelics, and we're trying to create a model where we can show that we can use a sort of state of the art, you know, randomized, controlled trial methods be really transparent, really a priori, but what we expect to find, and sort of set the tone for this is there is a way to do this correctly. It's annoying, doing everything correctly, like, you know, it would be much easier for someone to get, you know, mushrooms on the street or with an Internet order than to get Health Canada approval or something like that. But you know, what we're trying to do is create something that has some sustainability, and I think this, again, is an approach that, that I've applied in my colleagues to apply it in studying meditation, where now there is some relatively legitimate, like high caliber scientific evidence of meditations benefits and there just wasn't like 25 years ago, then it just comes from sort of standing up for scientific principles ahead of outcomes and then being open, like the outcomes will be useful and meaningful, even if they disconfirmed what we expect to happen because well at least believe like they're true representations of the mechanisms and effects of the drugs."}, {"speaker": "Sina Hadipour", "time": "11:19", "text": "So this is a perfect segue to our next guest, who is beginning to use psychedelics and formal clinical trials.

The funding will not be support faculty and staff within the Center for five years but will also give us the resources to really widely extend our understanding of the types and the breadth of indications for which psychedelic drugs may be efficacious. So, there will be a clinical trials; they will be conducted over the next five years with the center. We will test it in pilot and proof concept studies whether or not there's any reason to think that psilocybin may be helpful in treating some of the symptoms that accompany anorexia nervosa, PTSD, opioid use disorder, Alzheimer's disorder and mild cognitive impairment. And we will also be able to look at the effects of psychedelics in healthy individuals in terms of how psychedelics may affect creativity, micro dosing psychedelics may affect mood and cognition. And finally, we will conduct a large clinical trial to determine whether or not psilocybin can be helpful in treating patients with major depressive disorder and co-occurring alcohol use disorder. This is actually a highly prevalent co occurring set of disorders; nearly a quarter of all people with depression also have a substantial alcohol use problem. In addition to that, we will be collecting just a range of blood and behavioral and brain based biomarkers to determine whether we could eventually figure out why some people respond to psychedelic drugs and other people don't terms of therapeutic outcomes. And if you know for successful it's the it's the pie in the sky idea. If we're successful in understanding that, then we may be able to better tailor treatments to individuals in the future.

However, Dr. Barrett does caution against the belief that psilocybin is the cure to everything. The mechanism of how psilocybin works ais unknown. Dr. Barrett shared a few theories, which include disrupting the reward system that occurs with addictive substances, increasing connectivity between areas of the brain that are involved with executive function, attention, and higher cortical functions. And lastly, and most interestingly, he believes that psilocybin affects a part of the brain called the claustrum. The claustrum has long been seen as the seat of consciousness, due to its numerous connections with many parts of the brain. It also has the highest expression of serotonin-2A receptors, which are targets of psilocybin. This would explain the consciousness altering effects psilocybin. He plans to study this theory by using MRI to image the brains of those under the influence of psilocybin and monitoring the activity of the claustrum. In addition to these promising trials, psychedelics are being used in many different applications also. For instance, in Vancouver, researchers are starting a phase three clinical trial examining MDMA as treatment for PTSD. Another study at Johns Hopkins is examining the use of psilocybin and cancer patients and have found that psilocybin substantially reduced levels of depression and anxiety and patients with life threatening cancers. Another study from Harvard has shown that LSD can potentially be beneficial in those who suffer from cluster headaches. Now, these studies mostly focused on subjective experiences of those taking psychedelics, which is very important when studying these drugs. We'll now hear from Amber and her own experiences with psychedelics."}, {"speaker": "Amber Mullin", "time": "15:57", "text": "First time was acid or LSD when I was about 18; it wasn't the best use of it, I guess. Like anything else. I didn't know what I was doing at first. So somebody kind of gave it to me and we went saw movie, and the experience was very good, but it was a lower dose. When you look at media, there's all sorts of depictions, everything from seeing cartoon rabbits or something talking back to you, and that's not really what it's like at all. You do get what could be called visual hallucinations. But mostly it's, again, like colors, rainbow colors, fractal like geometric patterns, almost something you can compare it to like a lace or a doily type patterns. So those are the types of visual hallucinations. Again, it's not things that aren't there talking to you. It's more your visual systems are being over stimulated, being able to see the framework of how your visual system integrates information, and that manifests as kind of like this fractal geometric pattern that people describe. It was very overwhelming the first time I took it because, again, I didn't know what to expect. It's kind of like getting hit by a freight train. No matter how many times I've done it, or what psychedelics I've done, when you're coming up on it, like the effects are starting to happen, you get this almost sense of impending doom, almost like a nervous feeling like your body realizes something crazy is about to happen. Yeah, then once you take it, it takes a while to kick in depending on what you take, and then the first couple hours or what they call the peak, for me personally, I have a hard time speaking to people. I think very fast. It's almost like you can think multiple thoughts at the same time, but when you try to articulate them, they just train wreck coming out of my mouth. It was overwhelming, it was very fun. It was a very positive experience. And I just felt like my mood had been, in general, lifted a lot after that. It wasn't something that went away as the drug wore away. It stayed for a really long time."}, {"speaker": "Sina Hadipour", "time": "17:46", "text": "And what do you think made you want to try again?"}, {"speaker": "Amber Mullin", "time": "17:49", "text": "I have had what people would call a bad trip. I have had ego death, and that's what usually leads to a bad trip in my experiences. If you're not used to the sensation of ego death, ego death being the inability to distinguish yourself from your surroundings, so that sense of you as an autonomous individual person, it goes away. If you take very high doses, even if you're used to that feeling, it's very unnerving because it's hard to differentiate, for example, you have something on the TV between what's going on in the TV and what's going on around you, because you have lost your sense of self. There's something deeply unsettling about losing your entire sense of self. You're still having thought; it's very, very bizarre, but it's just you can't really distinguish yourself. And so then that leads to anxiety. But I guess, yeah, even knowing that you can have a bad trip, for me, definitely it's worth it because the net positive benefits have stuck with me and it fundamentally altered who I am and how I see the world and how I react to situations around me."}, {"speaker": "Sina Hadipour", "time": "18:46", "text": "That's very interesting.

And I guess back then, people weren't talking about it as much as they are now; this would have been like 10 years ago or so. So it was more of a curiosity, something that I wanted to try and get off my bucket list so to speak. But now, I have a great deal of respect for psychedelic substances. They're not something to just mess around with at a party; they're not something to just take impulsively. I always like to say that it's called a trip because it's like taking a trip. You don't usually just take a trip, right? You plan for it, you make sure you have that day off work, the next day off work, so you don't have to stress about anything. Treat it like you're going on a kind of mini vacation. I hate to use the word spiritual because I feel like it's thrown around quite a lot, but I don't really know any other way to describe it in terms of both the net positive it has and how I view it now having gone through it myself quite a few times. There's not really any other better word I can use to describe it other than I see it as a very spiritual experience for myself, a way to kind of reconnect with everything around me, with who I am as a person to reevaluate what I'm doing with my life and how I'm processing my life. So I have a lot of respect for it. I think that's what's changed is I've built a lot of respect for it."}, {"speaker": "Sina Hadipour", "time": "20:09", "text": "As I mentioned before, subjective experiences like Amber's can be indispensable and qualitative research on psychedelics. This was definitely the case with Dr. Farb's research. Dr. Norman Farb's group at UTM wants to study micro dosing in a controlled environment to better characterize the therapeutic and cognitive enhancing effects."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Norm Farb", "time": "20:29", "text": "Because there really is no recent safety data, our approach is that people will have to take the drugs in clinic and stay in clinic until the drug is mostly out of their system. So we're talking about like a pretty intensive commitment for our participants. This program really started based on doing some qualitative research with online participants, who are reporting different psychedelic use, and we did a paper on people who started reporting that they were micro dosing, so taking these sub-, you know, hallucinations, sub-delusion thresholds of drugs and saying  that it's really improved their sense of well being. Most micro dosing happens around every three days. But I think asking people to give us a full day, or not even, six hours or something; every three days is just not going to work despite the fact that there's a lot of unsolicited people saying, sign me up for your trial. That's a big commitment. So I think what we're looking at now is having people come in around once a week. When they come in, they are expected to be in the clinic, at least in the first few visits, for five or six hours with medical stuff around just in case, even though we don't expect any complications, just in case. And during that time, you know, we can get them do both relax, but also do a whole bunch of the psychological assessments we can get our assessment done while they're stuck there anyway. And what we're trying to do actually is crossover trial where people are in this study for about two months. They're on the drug for one of those two months, and they're on placebo for another month, and they are randomized both for the clinician on the floor and the assessors on the floor and for the participants which month is which. And that's, I think the you know, a very clean way to see within the same person. You get benefits, and for the people who start a randomized to start off on the drug, do the benefits persist when they are tapered into placebo or not. So there's a lot of really cool things we can get from that sort of trial design. And I'm excited about it because there's no way you can double blind meditation really, like, it's like the science of awareness. You can't like fake to trick people into not realizing they had awareness."}, {"speaker": "Sina Hadipour", "time": "26:51", "text": "Dr. Fred Barrett from Johns Hopkins also believes that additional research is required a micro dose."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Fred Barrett", "time": "26:57", "text": "There are some anecdotal pieces of evidence out there that psychedelic drugs, for instance, taken in micro doses do lead to increases in attention and mood and cognitive function. And really, there's been very, very little empirical data to investigate this question at all. There are a handful of papers, one or two that have recently been published that show that very, very small sub-acute, sub-threshold doses of psychedelic drugs actually lead to essentially no change with these technical tools that we have. Maybe, the only change that's been noticed as a change by paper that came out of University of Chicago very recently showing that in a very small doses of I believe LSD, if anything, just led to a slight impairment in detecting and responding to a certain type of facial emotional stimulus. The really interesting thing about the entire micro dosing movement is that, you know, most of the noise being made about micro dosing is being basically on self-report, anecdotal evidence, and while anecdotal evidence could be very valuable in guiding empirical science, the plural of anecdote is not data. And all of that you know, really substantial biases that come in doing that type of research. Survey research simply based on anecdote are substantial. So you know, you're very likely to not be attracting, you know, if you're conducting a study, you have to be really careful if you're conducting a survey study, you have to be really careful to try to attract people from all different opinion types to respond to your survey. Otherwise, there's going to be bias and reporting and subject selection. For the types of surveys that are completed being completed with micro dosing so far, many of them suffer from a pretty inherent bias the way they're worded. People who haven't had a good experience with micro dosing, either no experience or maybe even a negative experience, probably aren't motivated to fill these questionnaires out or report their experiences or complete these surveys, and there's an investigator out California or an individual rather who has collected, you know, a huge database of testimonials regarding micro dosing, but we have no idea what file drawer effect is there and how many novel reports are being, you know, not reported. And at the end of the day, this entire exercise of micro dosing has all of the hallmarks that are really beautiful and really powerful placebo effect. I take this drug that I can't detect in my body, but once I take it, I kind of feel better. And everybody else says you feel better when you do it. And you know, sun's a little brighter and you know, this safe drug people say it's a safe drug. I'm not saying it's a safe drug. I'm just saying people say, you know, this is part of the story around micro dosing, and hey, let me tell you, I am completely willing to be proven wrong here. I would love to be proven wrong here because what that means is if micro dosing is real, and the micro dosing actually does work, that's an incredible therapeutic that could be available to a ton of people and it could help a lot of people, I'm simply being very skeptical because really meager evidence that does exist from empirical, controlled studies suggest that there's no effect or maybe even a slight negative effect of these things, and the entire exercise does really wreak a placebo effect. So, what I'm waiting for is the definitive well controlled study to either give this some wheels or put it to rest."}, {"speaker": "Amber Mullin", "time": "30:26", "text": "While everyone we spoke to were interested in understanding more about the benefits of psychedelics, they all warned of the inherent dangers when dealing with these types of substances as well"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Fred Barrett", "time": "30:37", "text": "It can be the Wild West, I don't think that anybody is going to, any anybody who has experience and knowledge of these drugs, is going to say that they're not powerful drugs. They're very powerful drugs, and taken without the right type of support, without the right type of preparation, people can really get into trouble and cause themselves harm either psychological harm or physical harm. And It's not typically that the drugs have a physiological toxicity and healthy individuals, but they do have, you know, modest, reliable cardiac effects. There's reason to believe that they may not be safe for individuals who have a personal or family history with psychosis. Or, you know, it's unclear whether individuals who have suffered trauma would really have a safe experience without the care and counseling of a clinician during these acute effects. And, the same goes for patients with depression, patients of substance use disorders. So, clinical populations, really benefit seem to benefit, at least anecdotally, from the involvement of a clinician or someone who's clinically trained during the acute drug effects. We published a study in 2016 that was there was a product of a large internet survey, and of course, you know, a couple minutes ago as pooh poohing surveys, they do have their value and they do have their use, and in this particular survey, we asked the people who have had a challenging experience or a bad trip with psilocybin mushrooms to come to our survey and tell us all about it essentially, and for individuals who completed the survey, they sat down for at least a good half an hour to 45 minutes of answering questions and checking boxes and typing in responses. And then there are thousands upon thousands people who started the survey. There weren't quite that many who completed the survey. But yeah, there were, there were almost 2000 individuals who completed this survey and we went through each and every single survey response to try to identify people who were obviously goofing off and not getting system responses. And out of those, we found nearly 2000 individuals from around the world who completed this survey as best as we can tell completed earnestly, and we asked within the survey and quite a few questions to try to get a handle on various aspects of the bad trips that people had experienced, including who was there with you? And where they sober? Were they not sober? Did they have any training or experience with psychedelics before this? Was it a large group setting? Was it you in your basement? Were you at musical festival? Were you out the woods? Were you, you know, what are all the details and including, you know, did you cause yourself or others harm? Did you seek medical treatment for this? Did you seek psyciatric treatment for this? And would you repeat the experience? And volunteers, by large, indicated very challenging experiences. Some individuals indicated experiences that were very intense but very brief. Others indicated they had experiences that were moderate to severe intensity but very long and duration. I think roughly 10% of individuals who completed the study indicated that they had exposed themselves or others to harm. A smaller percentage of individuals did seek medical attention for experiences during their bad trip. A number of people also did seek psychological, psychiatric treatment after the experience for negative effect or anxiety or depression or panic or other types of, you know, negative experiences that persisted beyond the effects of the drug that they attributed to the drug. And the curious aspect of this is that many people also indicated that they would repeat the experience with all of the aspects of the bad trip involved, because there are a number of people who did feel that they learned from the experience, but some of that could be, hey, if I could survive, that I could survive anything. Right, like almost like a crucible. And the question then becomes, well, is it necessary? Is it really necessary to have that crucible experience in order to grow, you know? Maybe, maybe not. But what was clear from the survey is that there are really quite a myriad of challenges and risks for self-administering these drugs outside of controlled setting."}, {"speaker": "Sina Hadipour", "time": "34:50", "text": "Now that we've heard both sides, where do we go from here? We ask all of our guests the same question."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Fred Barrett", "time": "34:57", "text": "The question of accessibility has to be preempted by the discussion of therapeutic misconception. So, to talk about the accessibility of these therapies, we have to acknowledge that they're not approved therapies yet. We have to acknowledge that, while there's some really exciting preliminary studies and a ton of press built up around this, while everybody is, you know, promising that these drugs are going to fundamentally change psychiatry, that might be true, but it hasn't happened yet. And we haven't had large controlled trials to determine the the real gold standard of efficacy in any disorder whatsoever. And we haven't really mapped out in fine detail the limits of the efficacy and the limits of the safety of these drugs. We have some preliminary ideas, but there's a lot we don't know. And, frankly, you know, I like to say that if you give the wrong person at the wrong time, a large dose of penicillin or amoxicillin, you'll kill them, right? There's some people who are allergic to this, but if you give the right person the right dose of penicillin in the right context, you may save their lives. I don't think that we need to make such a drastic statement about psychedelics. But it's the same principle holds. This is going to work for some people, and it's simply not going to work for other people. We shouldn't expect the psychedelic drugs will be appropriate for everyone. And one of the things we need to understand better before this gets rolled out as an approved therapeutic is well, what are the boundaries of that? Can we get any sense of who this drug should not be given to and possibly why. So when you're when a person signs up for a research study with psychedelic drug, they have to understand that this is still research. And it's still research because we're still trying to really come definitive and whether we think psychedelics will work for one thing or another. So that one of the reasons that we're running so many proof of concept or initial pilot studies in the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research here at Hopkins, is because we want to start to begin to kind of map the boundaries of this space, like what what works and what doesn't. So within that context and with the clear understanding that these drugs are still in preliminary stages of research, accessibility to research studies is really the limit to accessibility to the substances. And so, as I kind of mentioned, and someone alluded to, there are a number of studies popping up around the world, really, that will be a potential possibility for people to inquire about and screen and try to enroll into. But really, the research context is the only approved legal way to to access these drugs in a therapeutic context at the moment. One of the best ways to figure out where and what and how and when, in terms of accessibility, is to go to a website called clinicaltrials.gov. This is a website that all federally funded research in the United States needs to register, and it's become the gold standard for pre-registration of research studies. So that means that when a person that's going to, when an investigator at an institution is going to plan and initialize study, they put the study, they put the whole plan up on clinical trials so that they can say in a public forum here, here's what we're going to try to do, here's what we think we're going to find. So that when the studies over, people can look back at that record, and then they can compare it to what was found, and they can, they can determine whether people were essentially doing what they said, and then really sticking to their original plan. But it also becomes a recruitment tool. So you can go on there and you can search for psilocybin, or you can search for LSD, or you can search for depression, or search for alcohol use disorder, or PTSD, whatever. And you can find all of the active and recruiting studies in the world, since many, many research institutions around the world have adopted this is also a gold standard for reporting what they plan to do in studies. So the best answer for accessibility is check out clinical trials.gov and see if there's anything near you or accessible to you. But it's really limited to research studies at this moment for the reason that we're still in the in the nascent stages of understanding how and when and why and where these drugs may work. The exciting part and the promising part is that there are now two separate organizations who are working with both the FDA and the AMA to design and conduct phase three registration trials, which are, you know, trials with the express purpose of coming into to a determination of whether or not there's sufficient efficacy, or evidence of efficacy of a drug to treat an indication that they can be approved for medical use, and these trials to take a number of years to complete. Once they're complete, they will actually take a number of years to pour over to have analyzed to get to discussions with the FDA and AMA, if these trials if either of these trials is successful, that may lead to the approval of psilocybin for the treatment of some form of depression. Once that happens, there are a number of other players in the field who are thinking now about how to come up with the infrastructure to roll these medicines out. That may happen within the context of specific psilocybin therapy clinics that may happen in some other context. But I'd say that a reasonable guess of what the timeline might be, you know, within 10 years, we may see the approval of psilocybin for some the treatment of some form of depression. And some people think that that's a really conservative estimate. Some people think that's a really liberal estimate. And so who knows?"}, {"speaker": "Sina Hadipour", "time": "40:36", "text": "So one of the final questions that I have for you is what do you think the future of psychedelic drugs is in medicine?

And couple months ago, we finally got approval at the provost level, both to accept the existing donation and also to do further fundraising, which is then still contingent upon us getting the right ethics approvals and finding good clinical sites to run the trials on and so on and so forth. So there's just been a lot of team, like network building over the past year. Now it looks like we've got some good partners at CAMH, like the Center of Addiction and Mental Health, where they're familiar with running drug trials on somewhat experimental drugs, we have some money in place we're applying for more grants. And the biggest sort of hurdle or challenge we're working on now is getting the full health candidate approval to work with a controlled substance, because although many people are doing an escalating number of people are self-administering psychedelics, you know, it's still a controlled substance and illegal to use without special permission. Yeah. Yeah. So that's where we are. Now we're just at the point of submitting the health care application. Now there's another there's a lot of other paperwork that's already underway. Then we have our sort of trial design all set up, and hopefully within the next two to six months, we'll have the green light to start recruiting participants. The broader implications of what it's like to have people walking around a little bit high all the time is interesting. And you know, culturally, we understand how that works with alcohol. We're starting to see how that plays out with marijuana. You can look at addiction to cell phones on the road is another thing we're trying to culturally understand. And yeah, I think psychedelics is the next sort of wave of self-administered psychotropics where people are trying to change their own minds from the bottom up, like in a chemical way. And I think a university, like a publicly funded university like the University of Toronto, is one of the best places to try to have a unbiased view of benefits and detriments so whether you're pro-drug or anti-drug, you would want to know what the drugs do. And I would trust the research center that doesn't have a commercial interest more than I would trust a company whose livelihood is dependent upon you buying that drug, you know, common complaint I guess for the way pharmaceutical research runs today."}, {"speaker": "Sina Hadipour", "time": "43:45", "text": "I asked Dr. Ed shorter from the History of Medicine program, a similar question.

So I don't think that would be very much resistance in this population to having these agents prescribed, but older people are still terrified. The whole idea of psychedelic drugs are associated with Timothy Leary, turn off tune and drop out. This left a very the sort of whole legacy of the late 1960s and 70s, left a very bad taste in people's mouths. And so if you try to revive something like LSD, there's gonna be a lot of resistance to it. But LSD had legitimate clinical use it for quite a while; it was used in the treatment of alcoholism, it was used in psychotherapy. There are other conceivable uses for LSD as well. Sandoz marketed it as Delysid.

And I'm happy to share because, as we've heard throughout this episode, psychedelics have always been steeped in mystery. And science is only beginning to unravel how they work not only on a biological level but on a more psychological and personal level as well. There are so many accounts of people having their lives transformed for the better by using psychedelics just once that it's almost impossible to ignore. Scientists can hear the signal in the noise and there is a growing push for more research into the benefits and the risks of such powerful substances. We had a lot of fun making this episode, and we hope you learned as much as we did from our little venture down the rabbit hole. Psychedelics can be a loaded term, but before you say off with their heads, just keep an open mind. For in the wise words of a certain Mad Hatter, everyone wants some magical solution to their problem, and everyone refuses to believe in magic.

I'm a physician who specializes in both Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and Occupational Medicine. I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine at the University of Toronto and Director of Academics and Research at Providence Health Care, Unity Health, Toronto."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "7:31", "text": "In addition to being a physician, Shane holds two Master's degrees, one in Human Thermoregulation and Cardiovascular Physiology, and another in Occupational and Environmental Medicine.

So, can you tell us a little bit about what inspired you to pursue that path of becoming an astronaut?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shane Journeay", "time": "8:11", "text": "Sure. So most of my background, even going back to my undergraduate days have really been all around fascination with human health and performance, both physical endeavors and physical function, the science and the excitement of you know, exploration and pushing humans to new limits, I always found that incredible from the get go. And throughout my graduate training and medical training, sort of each experience I had kind of kept coming back to space. And then I had the opportunity to attend the International Space University, which is in France that basically pulled everything together, and looked at the interdisciplinary nature of space. And so, you know, it was always sort of a goal of mine, to be involved in some of the research that may benefit space. And as I progressed in medicine, the benefits to people here on Earth, but really, I felt like I could have done a very good job as an astronaut."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "9:09", "text": "So how has the training and experience in training to become a physician been applicable directly to your experience trying to become an astronaut through the astronaut candidacy?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shane Journeay", "time": "9:20", "text": "So certainly from a human performance standpoint, both of my areas of medicine, Physical Medicine and Rehab, and Occupational Medicine, and that includes aerospace medicine and flight medicine, sort of all brought to the forefront the challenges that astronauts face, but certainly going through many years of medical training and research training, really position someone to potentially apply to become an astronaut or potentially fly in space. You need some physical attributes. You need stamina, you need to think under pressure with sick patients. You need to be a good communicator. All of which you get as a medical trainee in a residency program."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "10:05", "text": "And are there any particular physical or health requirements that are typically expected of an astronaut candidate?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shane Journeay", "time": "10:13", "text": "Yes. So you have to be fit and extremely healthy. And that being said, you don't have to be an Olympic athlete either. So some of the preliminary medical screening is just simply do you meet the bare minimum to potentially go on and do other such testing in order to go in space. However, in the final phases, astronauts undergo very rigorous testing, some of which is even far beyond what is required of their occupation. And then of course, you have to be fit to fly. So if you, let's say, you pass through the astronaut training down in Houston, and you're now called an astronaut, and you're ready to fly, you're still monitored to see if you're ready to go, and then when you come back, you undergo spaceflight rehabilitation, which is near and dear to my heart. And then you have to be ready to fly once again. So you actually have to recuperate from your time in space in order to be fit to fly a second time. So there's lots of things that come together."}, {"speaker": "Thamiya Vasanthakumar", "time": "11:19", "text": "Can you speak a little bit more about that recuperation process? Like what is the rehab like and why do they need it?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shane Journeay", "time": "11:25", "text": "So the human body in many ways was not meant to be in microgravity, right? The only thing our bodies know, you know, from the time we're in the womb till the time we're born is gravity. And so immediately upon entering microgravity, there's some very new changes. The vestibular system is really quite upset, people get nauseous and they throw up in space. But over prolonged periods, people can lose muscle mass, strength, bone density, there's a newer issue on the space station now that we've only seen with long duration flight, and that's vision loss. So a not insignificant number of astronauts have changes to their vision while on the space station. You're also isolated and you're exposed to more radiation than most people have ever known. So when they do come back, there's a preliminary phase. Some folks come back now and their blood pressure can drop so they can faint for the first few days, they can walk into walls. And there's actually a designated sort of rehabilitation program that occurs for them over the first few days first few weeks and first few months, which includes balance training, resistance training and cardiovascular training. The other piece to this is there's actually a really quite extraordinary piece of exercise equipment on the space station for both resistance training, and cardiovascular training and those exercise prescriptions are actually given out by exercise physiologist at NASA for each individual astronauts and so you'll see them, you know, on Twitter on NASA TV, they're running on that treadmill or doing the weight training, you know, the two hours a day sometimes and that is regimented. So if they stick to that, you know, some people were actually mitigating some of these effects on bone and muscle while they're on station. But it still doesn't change the fact they're a little dizzy and a little worn out from being on station for six months."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "13:32", "text": "Shane gave us an insider's look at the candidacy process to become an astronaut, and it involves a lot of steps and preparation to ensure that astronauts are well suited to the real thing: spaceflight. He also gave us some insights into the physiological effects of space on health. So we sat down with a former Canadian Space Agency astronaut Dave Williams to learn about what life's like in space. We also chat with Dave about his Canadian record for spacewalks. Applications of space science for robotics used in medicine here on Earth, and how being an astronaut is actually a lot like being a graduate student. "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "14:26", "text": "Yes, that's correct. I was very lucky, had the chance to do three spacewalks, spending over 17 hours outside the space station helping build the space station."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "14:35", "text": "That's incredible. And growing up, there were no previous Canadian astronauts for you to look up to. So what inspired you to become an astronaut? And what did your path look like?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "14:45", "text": "You know, I think the most important thing I've learned is don't let other people define your dreams for you find what it is you want to do and just go for it. I was seven years old in 1961 and I watched Alan Shepard lift off to go into space thought that's what I want to do with my life, I want to be an astronaut and be a scientist and do research in outer space and I was told that was impossible. Fortunately, I didn't believe the people that told me that and took many years later, I was 38. And I applied to the Canadian Space Program in 1992 and was very lucky to be selected as an astronaut."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "15:17", "text": "And when you're up in space, how did your eating, sleeping and hygiene change?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "15:23", "text": "So there's a whole host of questions about how our bodies adapt to being in space, simple things like eating in space, and I wrote a series of kids books, focusing on STEM, and it's the Astro Dave MD series of books. The first one is called to burp or not to burp, and that one deals with all the eating questions of going to the bathroom questions and things like that. But eating in space is very much like it is on Earth, except we're eating essentially freeze-dried food - it's like camping food. After a while the food gets a little bit boring. And in the beginning of the mission, your taste isn't the same as it is normally, you feel like you've got a cold with all the volume shifts that take place and fluid coming from your lower extremities up into your chest and your face. Your face gets really really puffy, your nose is congested, and things just don't taste the same so everybody likes horseradish or spicy sauces like wasabi."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "16:13", "text": "Right, right. And I heard one of your fellow astronauts really loved Tabasco sauce in space."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "16:17", "text": "Tabasco sauce is very popular. There's no question about it."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "16:22", "text": "And how is sleeping different in space because you can't just lie down to sleep because of the microgravity."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "16:28", "text": "Well in microgravity, you can sleep in any orientation you want. We have something called a sleep restraint system that essentially looks like a sleeping bag. You can attach it to the wall, the ceiling, the floor, whatever orientation you want to be in. And essentially all you do is you close your eyes and you fall asleep. Your arms will float up in front of you and your legs. If they're not in a sleep restraint system, your legs will bend a little bit. And the fun part is just simply taking a nap so you don't actually climb into your sleeping bag, you just close your eyes and float around."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "16:58", "text": "That's amazing. Truly an experience we don't really get here on Earth. And how does hygiene change in space? You mentioned that you wrote about this in your Astro Dave MD books but just a little bit of detail for our listeners."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "17:11", "text": "Yeah, so hygiene, everything seems to take a little bit more time when you're in space. So, we don't have a shower, onboard the Space Station, we certainly don't have a shower on the Space Shuttle or anything like that so you have to take a towel bath. So, you wet a towel and you basically wipe yourself off with that, we have rinse less shampoo that we use in our hair so you can shampoo your hair and then basically towel everything off. And that works pretty well. If you're exercising, you'll notice that sweat pools on your body and that's kind of a bizarre sensation and things but then afterwards, you take your top off and you clean yourself well and it works out well. But hygiene in space is just as important as it is on the ground so making sure that we're able to stay clean is very important."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "17:55", "text": "Right, and what kind of precautions did you have to take before a flight in order to Make sure you stay healthy."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "18:02", "text": "We do have quarantine before we go into space and typically in the US program, the quarantine lasts a week. And we lift off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida so part of that week, we're actually in Houston for three or four days, and then we fly down to Kennedy Space Center and we stay in quarantine the whole time before the space flight to make sure we don't get sick. In the past in the air of the Apollo spaceflight program, they also stayed in quarantine after they came back because they weren't sure if there were any living organisms on the surface of the moon and they didn't want to potentially contaminate the earth. And of course, they found out that there weren't any in the subsequent Apollo missions. There was no quarantine after the crew members came back."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "18:43", "text": "How did they select the time period for a quarantine before going up, so the week long period?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "18:48", "text": "So basically, they select the time period to make sure that you don't have any viral infections or infectious diseases like that when you go into space. That's the biggest challenge of course, prior to implementing quarantine, we did have crew members lift off to go into space with a cold or runny nose. And it makes it very difficult to be able to do a spacewalk because you have to equalize the pressure in your middle ear when you're in a lower pressure environment to the spacesuit. So that can be particularly problematic."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "19:16", "text": "Right? And I imagine just even inside that would be problematic because you already have that pressure buildup where your fluid is held in your upper body. And so that would be more uncomfortable for anyone who has a cold."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "19:27", "text": "Yes, any pressure changes would become very difficult. And of course, on board the space station, the space shuttle, the atmospheric pressure is the same as it is on Earth. But back in the days Mercury, Gemini and Apollo, the atmospheric pressure inside the spacecraft was a lot less so if they had a cold or upper respiratory tract infection it would be a significant problem for them."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "19:47", "text": "Yikes. And what kind of health or physical changes did you personally experience while flying?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "19:54", "text": "You know when you're in space, you become de-conditioned and your muscles lose strength, your bone density decreases roughly at around 1.5 to 2% per month, I was only in space for a couple of weeks, 14 days and 16 days so I had relatively minimal changes in my bone density but you could certainly feel the changes that take place in your strength, and more so in your lower extremities when you come back to Earth and you notice just standing up seems to take a lot more strength than it did before you lifted off to go into space. And that's one of the reasons why we exercise when we're in space to try and prevent some of these changes from taking place."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "20:30", "text": "Right, and what did for you specifically, what did recovery look like when you got back to Earth?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "20:35", "text": "So, I was very fortunate I recovered fairly quickly and generally the time that it takes to recover is about one and a half to two times the mission duration. So you know, if you're in space for six months or so it's going to be nine months to a year that it'll take you to get totally back to normal and it's similar with a short duration crew member so if you're in space for a couple of weeks, it's going to be you know, two to three weeks, maybe a month or so for you to get back into shape."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "21:02", "text": "And you flew with Scott Kelly, who participated in the famous twin study that was recently published, did you take part in a lot of research projects when you were in space? And what were some of the tasks that you did? What were maybe some of the findings from those projects, and I know that you were part of Neurolab, STS-90, so maybe you can speak a little bit about that."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "21:23", "text": "On Neurolab, STS-90, I was essentially there as a neuroscientist, but also there as a research subject as well. So we were understanding how the brain adapted to being in space. We had baby rats that we took into space with us who went through the critical window of developing their walking behavior in the absence of gravity. And then the question would be when they came back to earth and had to relearn how to walk on Earth, would they be forever space rats, and whether walking would be abnormal, or would they be able to relearn how to walk on earth after they've gone through that critical window of development? So it turns out, they were able to learn to re-walk, which suggests that these critical windows of development in the nervous system may have a degree of plasticity to them, may not be as fixed as we thought they were in the beginning of things. And it's really remarkable being able to take those scientific results from space and bring them back here on Earth."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "22:17", "text": "That's pretty phenomenal. That's a really cool research study. And how do astronauts in general collaborate, you were saying that you were there as a research scientist and a subject but how do in general astronauts collaborate with research scientists to develop our understanding of the effects of space on the human body?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "22:33", "text": "There has to be a really close relationship between the astronauts and the researchers, primarily because we become graduate students for some of the best scientists in the world. So whether we're doing life science experiment, fluid physics experiments, whatever it might be, we actually have to make those experiments work in space, work with all the hardware, solve any problems that take place, and make sure that we're getting publishable data for the investigators. So it's pretty exciting being able to do that."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "23:02", "text": "And I like what you said about being kind of like a graduate student, because that's something that a lot of our listeners can relate to as graduate students ourselves.

You know, you could start off by focusing on the technological issues associated with the challenges of medicine and what we're doing in space medicine and think about the evolution of technologies that have been built in support of the space program that are used every day in a hospital. Great example of that would be critical care monitoring, originally developed for the Apollo astronauts when they're walking on the surface of the moon, so we could record their heart rates but at the same time implemented in the 1960s in critical care units to be able to record and monitor electrocardiograph activity and then of course who evolved from there and you think about the application of big robots like the Canadarm to robotic surgery, and there have been tremendous spin offs. In fact, MacDonald Detweiler built neuroArm, it's a neurosurgical robot capable of being used with intraoperative MRI, a direct derivation of what we're doing on the space station, but essentially miniaturized. So part of the reason why we go to space is to be able to develop these technologies and improve health care back on Earth. But more importantly, we also begin to understand the changes that take place in the human body and spaceflight is all about physiologic transitions. You go from 1g on Earth, to 0g in space, and then if you're going to land on the moon or Mars, whatever it might be, there's a partial gravitational environment, then back to 0g coming back to earth and then back to 1g. So how do we optimize those? And I think what we learned from that is the importance of being able to mitigate things like bone loss and osteoporosis and if we can apply what we learn in space to the aging population, maybe we can decrease the rate of bone loss associated with aging. We understand the whole process of cardiovascular conditioning, vestibular dysfunction and vertigo and things. So, all of these lessons that we learn in terms of how the body functions in space are directly applicable to healthcare here on Earth."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "25:23", "text": "Those are some pretty cool applications for here on Earth and I loved hearing about how the Canadarm kind of inspired a miniature version for neurosurgery.

And they found that over 50% of the astronauts from shuttle flights have increased viral shedding of one or more herpes viruses in their saliva or urine. And this percentage is increased for astronauts on longer missions, like the ISS missions, suggesting there's a time component to this observation. The exact mechanism of how this happens is not known.

To learn more about the Vection project specifically we sat down with lead investigator of Vection Dr. Laurence Harris. Dr. Harris is a professor of Psychology, Kinesiology and Health Sciences and Biology at York University. But first, what is Vection?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Laurence Harris", "time": "31:05", "text": "Okay, so Vection refers to a project which is looking at our perception of self-motion. The term vection describes the sensation of self-motion, when you yourself are actually still but the world next to you is moving. You might have experienced this where you're in a car or in a train, and the train next to you or the truck next to you moves away and it gives you the sensation that you're in fact the one that's moving. So, it's part of our normal, everyday experience but it's unusual to have only visual cues. But when I move normally just forwards and backwards or whatever around the room, I'm receiving visual motion, as well as my other cues that tell me about it. And those cues are integrated in the normal way in a multi-sensory integration way and so they contribute to our perception of how we move around the world and how I know where the door is and how I know where you are and all that sort of thing as I change my relationship to you by moving around the room. So that's what we're actually looking at here, we're looking at how your perception of self-motion is influenced by the lack of gravity. So, in order to do that we are using visual cues in space and asking people about their perception of their self-motion. Now, in order to present those cues, what we're using is virtual reality. So, they're wearing an Oculus headset, so that we can control what they see visually and they're suspended in the middle of the module in a space module there so they don't bump into things because once you wear a helmet, you can't see anything and you're in danger of possibly bumping into things, which obviously, makes NASA very nervous. So we have to make sure that the people are safely held away from the walls of the spacecraft. It's also important from our science that they don't bump into things because that would give them other cues about whether they were moving and so forth. And so inside this Oculus inside the virtual reality display, we show them targets, they see a corridor stretching off into the distance and down that corridor there are various targets. And so they're asked to look at these targets one at a time and the target then disappears, and we move the corridor past them, that produces the vection sensation that they themselves are moving down the corridor. If you've ever played any video games, you know that this can be quite a compelling experience. And all they have to do is press a button when they get to the target. And that gives us an idea of how much optic flow, how much visual motion they need, in order to perceive that they've gone through a certain distance. And we do this at several different distances so we can actually end up calculating how their brain is using the visual motion to tell them about their physical motion. So that's one of the experiments that we're doing. A second one is an order to sort of understand the first one, because we're giving them targets at different distances. And then we're asking them to move to those targets. What if it's the perception of the distance that's incorrect, not their own movement, but the perception of the targets. So we have a second experiment in which we're trying to measure that. The third experiment is even more ambitious. The third experiment is looking at whether we can create visual gravity. What we do is we accelerate people down this corridor, and then suddenly everything goes blank. And they're asked to arrange the floor of the virtual world to indicate where they see the floor relative to where the floor was before they started. The idea being that if they interpret the visual acceleration as a new gravity, then that will be in an orthogonal direction to their where they were moving. And they should therefore see gravity as moving into that plane as well. And they'd have to tilt the floor to match that orientation. But that's, that's the third experiment. A little more ambitious than the other two rather exciting in terms of its possibilities."}, {"speaker": "Sina Hadipour", "time": "35:04", "text": "These are very innovative techniques to examine the perception of motion in microgravity. I know you've worked with astronauts just like David Saint-Jacques, who was the most recent Canadian astronaut to come back from the International Space Station, are you able to share some of the preliminary results that you've found with him?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Laurence Harris", "time": "35:19", "text": "Well, data from an n of one is always a controversial thing to do so I don't think I want to tell you anything about the actual results that we've found with this with one astronaut, but we are gradually collecting from a larger population, where we're going to have seven at least and we may be able to extend the project to cover even more astronauts later on. It's only then that will be able to make statistically sensible statements. So, I'm afraid I can't actually say anything at this point about the data."}, {"speaker": "Sina Hadipour", "time": "35:48", "text": "I see. Do you have a hard time convincing astronauts to participate in your experiments?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Laurence Harris", "time": "35:54", "text": "No, no, I don't. The way that this works is that we have to address each astronaut with a description of the project and so forth. On a couple of occasions, I've gone down to JSC, the Johnson Space Center, to talk directly to the astronauts about this and often we do it by video link. The astronauts get a detailed experimental explanation of what we're going to be doing for 15 minutes, a very tight 15 minute window that we're allowed to talk to them and to present the project. And then they may ask us some clarifying questions or something, and then they go away and eventually they decide either they're going to do the project or not to do the project and they'll sign the ethics accepting form accordingly. Our project is in competition with more physiologically based projects, such as involving blood samples, or bone samples, or I don't know exactly what but other sort of more biological and more invasive procedures. So, the idea of playing a video game in space in virtual reality is generally rather appealing, and so far we've had a very high success rate for the people signing up to do the experiment."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "37:07", "text": "As we alluded to earlier, Vection is the sixth of a series of projects run by the CSA dedicated to health research.

This has been reported in many aspects such as T cell functioning, B cell functioning, different levels of inflammatory cytokines, things like that. So, these previous studies have typically taken blood samples before and after flight and then you know, some studies have also taken blood samples during flight as well but there's never been a platform on board of the International Space Station to analyze these results in real time. The samples that are taken during flight in the past have had to basically being transmitted back down to earth upon the astronauts return. So with that, I guess the two main goals of the immunoprofile project are that for one, it wants to establish the capacity for this blood analysis to take place on board of the International Space Station through a new piece of hardware called the bio analyzer, which I can talk a little bit about later. And then the second piece is, of course, to explore the dynamic changes in immune function throughout spaceflight."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "38:33", "text": "I can see the utility in sort of tracking the immune function over time versus what happened with the twin study where they took samples before and after coming for sure. So, can you describe more about the bio analyzer equipment that you mentioned earlier?"}, {"speaker": "Marieke de Korte", "time": "38:51", "text": "Absolutely. So essentially, it's a new piece of hardware that's been developed for this project, and it will allow for the capability to perform blood analysis on board of the International Space Station. So, essentially, it'll be able to track immune cell counts, as well as cytokines measurements to measure the overall immune status of the astronauts. As it stands now, the bio analyzer is still sort of in its development phase so the first iteration of the piece of hardware has been sent to the International Space Station and was actually tested by the Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques. There's a few tweaks that have to happen before it can be used in a research context but it's very exciting and we're hoping to get it up and running soon."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "39:35", "text": "Marieke also gave us insight on her second project examining the effects of microgravity on specific immune compartments."}, {"speaker": "Marieke de Korte", "time": "39:43", "text": "So, I'll just give a brief background on the other project that I'm working on. So I'm conducting simulated microgravity experiments so that I can do some research on Earth as well but within the sphere of space medicine. Essentially what I'll be doing is subjecting natural killer cells to simulated microgravity to assess how that condition changes the cells in general and their functionality and things like that."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "40:09", "text": "How do you induce certain microgravity environment?"}, {"speaker": "Marieke de Korte", "time": "40:14", "text": "That's a great question. So, I have a piece of specialized equipment that does it for me and it's basically a rotary cell culture device. So, what it does is it rotates the cell culture on a horizontal axis, and essentially keeps the cells in a constant state of freefall so when the cells are rotating synchronously with the vessel, it basically induces randomization of the gravity vectors which essentially models microgravity. So, we're able to induce that condition that way and study its effects on Earth."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "40:50", "text": "Oh, that sounds great.

You know, parabolic flight is definitely used as well. It's a little difficult for use in a biological context because when you're doing parabolic flight, you only get about 20 seconds of microgravity at a time so it's not really enough time to activate anything biologically relevant, unfortunately.

So, we understood that we have to solve the data problem. How do you build a system that can collect data, ideally passively from patients at home in real life situations so that you can feed the software that can help our health system, manage these populations efficiently and to improve outcomes and do it with the resources we have. So it's been a long journey but now we have a very stable system that can operate at a large scale that has been used by thousands of users in dozens of countries around the world for health research for taking care of people at home, with first responders, with astronauts, with athletes, by pharma companies and universities all around the world."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "44:19", "text": "That's incredible and you mentioned astronauts, and your company has recently launched Astroskin, an intelligent textile based product for use in space and space science.

We hope to collaborate also with private space companies that are going to be sending astronauts in space most probably starting next year to collect additional data and basically, we want to build the largest data set of vital science data in microgravity in the world so that can support these medical assistance for long term space missions."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "47:24", "text": "That's out of this world, that's really cool.

So, they wear it during training, and the astronauts do a lot of exercise, they do typically two hours of exercise a day or more than two hours of exercise a day. That's just to try to preserve their muscle mass and bone and they're still losing a lot of it. And one of the main challenges for astronauts in the ISS is sleeping. The thing is, our sleep is regulated a lot by the amount of light and sunlight that we get here on earth.

And so our understanding of how we lose bone, how we lose strength, how we lose balance can really make some gains in this area and so that's really paramount to what I do on a daily basis.

So for example, there's a loss of bones and challenges to the cardiovascular system and so forth. So, these changes are thought to possibly model or be useful to model effects of aging. Now on Earth, there are clinical situations where self-motion is not so easy. For example, in Parkinson's syndrome, they have problems with the shuffling movements and so forth, they're not clear about their movements and one of the big problems with Parkinson's patients is that they tend to be unstable and to fall over. So, understanding how the vestibular cues and the visual cues can adapt to each other and be malleable, will hopefully be very helpful for helping such patients on Earth. How it adapts in space may give us some clues about how we might be able to adapt it here on Earth."}, {"speaker": "Marieke de Korte", "time": "54:50", "text": "Even the technologies that are developed for space can be translated back down to earth as well.

Some of them are research projects from universities or clinical trials from pharma companies, and others are research on rare diseases. With rare diseases, in some cases you only have access to a few hundred patients and to run research and to collect data on these patients you need to recruit patients in maybe 15 different cities. So how do you manage data collection of vital signs in that kind of population that's very sparse, they're everywhere. It needs to be convenient. You want to record a lot of data. I think that's the beauty of it."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "55:57", "text": "Finally, for all you astronaut hopeful or anyone needing a bit of inspiration to help reach some distant goal.

And that was one of the reasons why I wrote the book. But more importantly, I wrote the book to share with everyone the importance of living life to the fullest while we can, because as a physician, I've seen many patients at the end of their lives with regrets and they say, I only wish I had spent more time with my family or spend more time with my kids, traveled more, or done things like that instead of working more. So that was one of the reasons why I wrote the book. But I also wanted to point out that sometimes life is not a linear journey, there's twists and turns and ups and downs and I actually don't believe that the importance of life is the pursuit of happiness. I believe that the most important thing in life is the pursuit of meaning. And I found that when I was 50 years old and I was diagnosed with cancer, I lost all my medical certifications as an astronaut and a pilot, I had to get it all back. And I flew in space on my second spaceflight as a cancer survivor but that journey wasn't easy. When I was first diagnosed, I actually thought I was going to die and I'm a doctor, I should probably know better. But we're humans first and that's the initial reaction when you hear catastrophic news like that. So it really is all about the journey. Don't let other people define your journey for you. Work hard, be resilient. Try and find the meaning and all the challenges that we face and life can truly be an amazing process."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "57:37", "text": "That's a pretty inspiring story. Thanks for sharing that. Can you tell us a little bit more about your book, you have now your paperback release of this best-selling book Defying Limits?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "57:47", "text": "Yes, well, thanks very much. I'm thrilled that it's now out in paperback and came out in hardcover but 11 months ago actually, and it initially became a best seller in Canada. I was absolutely thrilled that that happened and over the last year I'd been on speaking circuits talking about the book. And basically, the book does center around my life, but it also focuses on the lessons that I've learned throughout my career and the challenges that I've had in going forward and being able to achieve my dreams and fly in space. It speaks about the beauty of exploring space, and how incredible that really is to look out at the black infinite void of space and see our beautiful blue planet cast against this darkness of space."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "58:31", "text": "What advice would you have for anyone who's interested in going into space health research or becoming an astronaut themselves?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Dave Williams", "time": "58:37", "text": "So I think the important thing is to believe in yourself, believe in your dreams recognize that the probability certainly of becoming an astronaut is very small. It's a very competitive process so don't solely rely on becoming an astronaut. I think one of the things, it's for me very important as a love of science, a passion for scientific research. So I would have continued my career in research and as a researcher, had I not become an astronaut, it's just I was able to do both of those things but do it in space, which makes it even more exciting. But I think you know, it is important to have those dreams and to be able to pursue those dreams. I've said many times, don't let other people define your dreams for you and that's so critical. Also, don't think of things as being impossible. You know, when I was in first year as an undergraduate, which was in the last millennium, I was taught that it was impossible to map the human genome and now we're doing genomics onboard the International Space Station. So I think the use of the word impossible, we should probably actually get rid of that word out of our vocabulary. Take the letters, \u2018im' out of the word impossible and try and aspire to make the impossible possible. And whether you're doing that in pursuing a career in aerospace studies or research or as an astronaut, or whether you're doing that as a clinician doesn't really matter. You know, if we believe that it's impossible to find a cure for cancer, we're not going to find a cure for cancer, if we believe it's possible, and I know how very difficult that would be and how challenging it would be, then it may very well be possible. But we can't find solutions if we believe that there are no solutions."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "1:00:17", "text": "That's some really excellent advice.

Let's dive in."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "1:08", "text": "Despite our political differences, all Canadians benefit from our country's continued success in science and other research. In our last episode, number 65, we discussed how government funding of science works and how it has been seriously lacking in recent decades.

And then you move forward and it's just a recognition that everything we have, in so many ways, is a function of research. You think about the rule of law, civil society, our commitment to equity and diversity, all these things are products of social science and the humanities asking difficult questions about a just society. You know, the contribution that research and inquiry has made to the civilization we enjoy, under threat a bit these days with nativism and populism, but the contribution made by scholarship and science is massive and we simply have to get that message out to the Canadian public consistently constructively, and target them as much as we target the politicians. Then I think this constant, you know, jockeying with the federal government will be very different and we will have a lot more decision makers who get it and who believe it and who want to make a difference with us."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "3:00", "text": "The scientific community in Canada has struggled for many years with capturing the attention of politicians. As Dr. Naylor mentioned, we seem to be constantly jockeying with the federal government for money because science isn't seen as an issue that really matters and it often becomes an easy target for politicians looking for something to cut. This is partially because the public isn't as engaged with science as they are with issues that more directly affect their wallets. We hope that this episode will be part of a wider and vital effort in the community to change that. The importance of public engagement was emphasized in a conversation I had with Dr. Molly Shoichet, Professor at the University of Toronto and former Ontario Chief Scientist, a role she was removed from with the recent change in government, and which has remained vacant under the current provincial administration."}, {"speaker": "Molly Shoichet", "time": "3:48", "text": "And you might say like, why is it important for people to know what science is? And part of that is, first of all, if you don't know it exists, you can't value it. But then why should you value it? I think you should value it because it impacts everything you do in life. You know, if you think about just how you get to work, even if you walk or take a bicycle, you know, you're walking on roads, you know, if it's in the winter, they're clear of ice, so you're not falling. You know, even simple things, even like, if you play soccer, even your soccer balls are much more technologically advanced today than they were before. But then, of course, there's all you know, the more obvious things like the iPhone, and people are living longer.

But I do think people use science to advance their own political agendas. And, unfortunately, there's just a lot of \"stuff\" on the internet. And you know, as soon as it's published people use that as a truth or they use that as a way to represent their gut feelings or what they \"just know\". And so that has led, to and we have also a lot of, what I'll call, celebrity science, where people with large voices and large followings engage or use their voice to advance what they think they know is right. And so that's led to a lot of confusion amongst the public and that's really unfortunate, because, you know, we've gone backwards in so many different areas - the most obvious ones around vaccines or climate change, and that is a misuse of science.

Policy for science is something that most researchers are aware of, for example, how can we best allocate funding to fund research? Or how can we help support trainees in science? So it's basically all the rules and policies that you can take to kind of govern science and research itself. But then science for policy is how you can use science to inform decision-making. Now science is just one of the many inputs in the policy making process. There's also economics, budgetary trade-offs, public opinion, and so on.

And so the science minister was appointed, that was a positive step, a new one. Kirsty Duncan not only became the science minister, but our rarity in public life had a PhD - a challenge we face more generally in this country, not enough public servants and politicians with a research background. And the minister made it pretty clear early on, she was concerned about funding, had picked up the message that the Harper government had focused on applied research, had not provided a lot of funding in general, but particularly earmarked towards applications and innovation. So, from early on in her term, as Minister, Dr. Duncan emphasized the need to think about how to support independent fundamental science. And to give the government credit, right from the outset, they signalled an intent to appoint a Chief Scientist, and they proceeded with that, and I think that was 2017 in the Fall, and they also took steps to restore the right of federal scientists to speak freely with the press and on the record, another step that I think affirmed independence of thought, and a commitment to evidence, whatever it was. So there were things that had taken place right out of the gate that were positive, but the main response was in Budget 2018."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "9:05", "text": "Direct involvement of scientists in the governing process is one obvious way to ensure that science evidence and the scientific method are incorporated into political decision making, as well as to ensure that science remains a priority period. It's also vital to ensuring that we have advocates at the table pushing for considerations such as funding. A Chief Scientist with a strong mandate can make a big difference - something to perhaps ask candidates about when they come knocking on your door."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "9:34", "text": "We asked Dr. Shoichet, for her thoughts on the lack of scientists in government and whether that might be changing."}, {"speaker": "Molly Shoichet", "time": "9:40", "text": "You know, I would love to see more scientists in government, because then I think the decision makers will be more engaged with understanding science and, and not just science, but that whole methodology, that we all take for granted, but you know, we're very methodical you know, even though we might discover something completely unexpected, we at least start off in a very structured way. So I can tell you that more of my PhD students are going into government positions, not as necessarily running for public office, but going into the public service and that I think, is equally important because those are, you know. The politicians have to get elected and, you know, are obviously integral to the decision-making, but they're influenced a lot by people in the public sector, who can provide that evidence and help guide them in their decision-making. That's actually something I was really excited about when I was Chief Scientist, was a little bit of showing scientists that \"Hey, look! We can have a role in government too!\""}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "10:50", "text": "While getting more scientists involved in government, in an elected capacity or otherwise, is an important long-term goal.

So this is kind of a new area that I tried to explore during my PhD. I also during my PhD felt completely in love with microbes. And so it's kind of been a mission for me to try to use my microbes in fun ways to try and make them beautiful and use them to inspire other people to also fall in love with microbes. So during the course of my PhD, I was just chugging along, and then a couple of days after the PC government was elected, they announced that they were firing the Ontario Chief Scientist, Dr. Molly Shoichet, but said that they would find a suitable and qualified replacement. So at the time a lot of people in our work area and all across the internet were kind of upset by this - it was such a bad sign coming straight out of the election and also because this position is so important. And while they said that they were going to hire a new person to fill this role, it really was important that the person hired into this position had a strong background in science, but also that they would be the voice for scientists and would represent what the Ontario scientists want to be presented to the government. So it was important and it was kind of upsetting that this was happening. So while I was stewing on my feelings about this, obviously, Evidence4Democracy was already doing something. And within a couple of days, they had a campaign started to advocate for the hiring of a new Chief Scientist. Right away, they had a campaign and I went on the website, I just put in my name and my postal code and immediately from there, they sent an email to both Premier Ford, and to my MPP to tell them that I cared about this issue and I wanted a new Ontario Chief Scientist to be hired. And the same would be for the Vote Science campaign, they'll contact your MP right away. So that's really easy, and I did it, but I felt kind of unsatisfied because I was just thinking about how many emails a day you get and how easy it would be for my MPP to just ignore that email all together. So I decided to turn to my friendly pathogenic fungi to see if they would help. So I wanted to grab the attention of my MPP but first I need to learn a little bit more about him. So the MPP for my riding, which is King-Vaughn is Stephen Lecce. And he is part of the Progressive Conservative Party, this was his first time being elected, but also his first time running, but he had experience in policy before, in politics before, working for the Prime Minister's Office under Stephen Harper. And now, since then, he's been sworn in as Ontario's Minister of Education. So from my research, what I found was that he seemed to really care about our riding and cared about the people in his riding, but also the he was young. And so I did the millennial thing and I turned to social media. So I got out my fungal friends and I decided that I would write out his name in fungi on a petri dish and let it grow. And then I did just did this simple thing: I sent a quick tweet to him to invite him to come to my lab to learn about my science, but also to talk about the need for a Chief Scientist. And so I kind of left that out to the universe and kind of walked away, went back to my experiments and didn't really think about anything. But then two, less than two, hours later, I had a response from him right away, saying that he was willing to come and meet with me and talk more. And this was such an exciting thing for me, because it really was very minimal active effort on my part, you know, the fungi did all the work for me and it was so exciting that he had agreed to come and to talk to me. And so I really want to emphasize again that while it may not always work this easily, it doesn't have to be a lot of work to have this come to play. And then I started panicking because then I had understanding what I had actually volunteering to do. And so I needed to, you know, do whatever researcher does and just gather more information and, and ask for help and try and get more resources to feel more comfortable with this. And luckily, at the time, I had help from Kathleen Walsh, who used to work for Evidence4Democracy and she was amazing in coaching me through the experience. I also talked to Dr. Molly Shoichet, and she helped me to learn a little bit more about the role. And I also sent out a quick survey to all of the scientists I knew in my Department, in my university, and on Twitter, just to find out what people cared about and to make sure that everybody wanted this Ontario Chief Scientist and find out other things that they cared about that I could bring up. So that really helped me to feel like I had the information and then I was ready to go. So then, you know, we set up the meeting with Stephen's staff and within a couple weeks, he visited my lab and we had a great meeting. I gave him a tour or lab space and introduced him to some of the cool science that we were doing in my lab as well as some of the research going on around us. I also had a little bit of like fun experiments that he could do where he could observe science himself so that he could really feel more connected and engaged with the science - we looked under a microscope, we had him pick up some plates, and we took some cool pictures. But at the same time, what it really allowed me to do is within that having fun is also have conversations about things that I cared about. So talking about the need for the Ontario Chief Scientist, talking about funding and scholarships. I was lucky to have funding during my graduate degree from both the Ontario government and the Canadian government and those really shaped my graduate career. I also feel strongly about the need for more resources for outreach and knowledge translation so that we can share our discoveries with everyone. And then lastly about the need for diversity and inclusivity in STEM and I shared my story of how coming from an immigrant family and not having anybody to look up to that you went to university. It really meant a lot to me to break the cycle of having women in my family being under-educated and how it meant a lot to be able to share that with my community and with my family. And so overall, the meeting was fun, engaging. It was pretty short, about 30 minutes or so, so it didn't take too much time. And it really felt like I was talking with a friend and I think we both got to learn a lot. Now, whether it was productive or not is debatable, because we still don't have an Ontario Chief Scientist, but overall, overall I will say that it was a great experience, and I would recommend it for everyone."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "18:28", "text": "Let's return to our discussion of the recent history of science policy in Canada.

They downplay the importance of improving support for science and the development of a science culture in Canada and put their focus on other goals in spheres such as healthcare and job creation. This is of course problematic given how important science is in all of these areas and more."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "20:09", "text": "Science touches on all aspects of society. To de-prioritize science is to de-prioritize the health, safety, well-being and future prosperity of Canadians.

We need to create a sense of the urgency in this country of making Canada smarter. And part of that comes back to the constant misrepresentation of data, I'm sorry to say, by the federal government above all. There's two elements of data that I see misrepresented by politicians, you know, include the provinces and territories here. One is our educational standing. Canada is the \"education nation\". We're second to Korea in the OECD data in terms of higher education attainment at the tertiary level, but that's driven overwhelmingly by college diplomas and college degree holders and our university baccalaureate output is average and our graduate degree holder levels are below-average for peer nations. So, you know, it's a case where you you mix the fruit salad here, there, it looks like there's lots there. By no means am I saying we should should cut back on vocationally-oriented degrees and diplomas, they're valuable and I respect the work that our colleges do there and we're fortunate to have them. The point is to ramp up the rest, and not confuse ourselves with statistics that really are aggregates rather than relevant to the discourse about making sure we have those creative and critically minded people with graduate degrees who will drive the economy of tomorrow and make a better society. The second statistic I've highlighted many times going back, gosh, a dozen years that's the Higher Education R&D statistic. This is spending through the Higher Education sector that is calculated as a percentage of GDP. And for some years, we had Canadian governments boasting that we had the highes, it's called HERD for short, highest HERD ratio in the G7, or G8 as it then was. This even turned up in Budget 2018, despite the fact that over the course of about 300-400 words of analysis and graphics in the FSR report, we showed that it was a totally misleading statistic, which I think tells you it was willful. This was, you know, a third finger salute from the people who wrote the budget to say, \"Hey, we're going to go on using the statistic it's true, even if you can show that it's misleading.\" Very, very bad faith stuff, I forewent comment on it at the time, I continue to regarded as appalling - you'll see the slide on the public deck is a Pinocchio icon in the bottom because I think it borders on an outright lie to use data that way. And so the reality is that universities support the HERD ratio to the tune of about 50% of the number, it's a little lower now because of Budget 2018, It hasn't fallen a lot. Industry is a small player because Canada has some of the lowest R&D spending by industry in the OECD - this is a big concern for us, although, full kudos to our business leaders, our economy still thrives, so we seem to be getting away with that one and whether we will long term is an open question. The provinces provide a small amount. The federal government when we did our report was at 23%. And as I said, publicly, you know, if a student began boasting that they had achieved top marks because of the paper where they plagarized 75% of the data or the text, they would get a zero. And my view is the conduct of the federal government is analogous to that student when they boast about this and they're minority contributors."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "23:57", "text": "Governments are clearly not immune to the Increasing phenomenon of misrepresentation of scientific evidence. Politicians of all stripes will often misstate or misconstrue facts to suit their political purposes."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "24:10", "text": "We've already mentioned one way we can solve this problem, and many others, advocating as a community for the inclusion of evidence in the decision-making process and fact-based policies in general. We asked Dr. Shoichet to expand on what evidence informed decision making looks like in government."}, {"speaker": "Molly Shoichet", "time": "24:31", "text": "All of us want to be making decisions based on evidence versus emotions - those are two, sometimes contrasting, pulls on our decision-making. But I think evidence is really important so that we're making the best decisions. If we make decisions simply based on emotions, then, first of all, we're not learning from any of the knowledge that we've created. And whether that's learning from science or history, you know, we really have to, as humanity, want to move forward, and if we're always making decisions based on our emotions, then then we'll probably just be stuck in that rut. So I think what evidence does and with the, with additional knowledge that we've gained, that gives us that opportunity to make better decisions, and to, you know, really for humanity and for the world. There's more than just the evidence that goes into making a decision. So decisions are complicated, and there's a lot of different things that one has to think about in making a decision. When I was the Chief Scientist, what I was really focused on is at least having evidence form part of that decision. And so that's this idea, as you've called it evidence-informed decision-making, so that the decisions that you are making at least you know, what the evidence says and where the evidence points that decision. I think another challenge that we face generally in science is that we all recognize as scientists that we can give you the best advice based on what we know today. But as scientists, we also acknowledge that we're going to know more tomorrow, and that our advice tomorrow might be different from our advice today. So this then also makes it very confusing for the public. And I think challenging for us as scientists to give definitive advice. But if our politicians are depending on us for that advice, then we have to give it based on what we know today. But I think it's because there's a myriad factors that go into making a decision that our goal has to be to, at minimum, have the evidence be part of that decision-making. But you know, and, you know, you might say, Well, you know, politicians are there to be re-elected, you know, that is their focus. And so, then they have to think about, well, what do people want and why; what was somebody want in order to elect me again? You know, and so, that can be, maybe that's a limitation of our democracy in that there's always that need to be re-elected and brings a somewhat of a shortsightedness to policies, but but not always. And I think we as the population are asking for more. There's there's so many pulls on making a decision. And maybe if we sort of break down the electoral one, like, why will somebody vote for you? I think, honestly, part of it is emotional; like they like you, they think you're friendly, you think they think they can relate to you. But the other reasons would be, \"Wow, I've got a job now and I didn't have a job before so I can, you know, I can support my family or I can support myself\". Though it's really important for people to have jobs, you know, to have some economic stability. It's really important for people to have a safe place to live. It's really important for people to have you know, clean air and clean water. So all of these things go into, you know, safety, health, education. - these are all the top button issues that we hear about. And, you know, obviously we're in a campaign right now. But those are, I think, what resonate with people and what will get people elected. And so well, you know, we might say, Oh, it's just about politicians just want to be elected, if you break that down, you can see that they're being, not always, but presumably being elected because they think that their life will be better under one politician versus another."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "28:32", "text": "Dr. Shoichet also spoke about her role as Ontario's Chief Scientist."}, {"speaker": "Molly Shoichet", "time": "28:36", "text": "The Chief Scientist has that opportunity to be the voice of science in government. What was really exciting for me when I was Chief Scientist is that I was really welcomed across all of the different Ministries in the Ontario government. And I didn't know that that would happen, but I was welcomed as much by the Ministries focused on social Issues like housing and poverty, as I was by the Ministries focused on the economy and jobs and research and innovation. So that was really exciting to me. And I think, you know, the Ontario public servants and certainly across Canada as well, the bureaucracy in government are really trying to do the best they can for the people of Ontario and recognize the importance of evidence and want to do a better job of it, but also acknowledge, you know, just even the scientific methodology. So, of course, there's no one person that can represent all of science, but certainly can bring that scientific methodology into decision-making. And so that was something that was actually already happening in government, but then I was able to help champion and so there's that role and then also working with different ministries just to incorporate that into their decision-making, so that we have more of that evidence-informed decision-making in government."}, {"speaker": "Frank Telfer", "time": "30:10", "text": "While single voices, especially of highly accomplished scientists, such as Dr. Naylor and Dr. Shoichet, can can have an impact, we can make an even greater difference if we work together.

It's especially important at a time like this because single individuals advocating for science is good but when we all come together and advocate together, we send a bigger message. For example, in the past, with the Fundamental Science Review, the whole science community came together with calls like #SupportTheReport (implement the Fundamental Science Review recommendations) and that did make a change, we saw an increase in the funding allocated towards science in the 2017 and 2018 federal budgets.

And that was shared between the states and the federal government. And right through the terrible decline of 2008-09, when the world economy crashed, they kept up the increases, whereas here, of course, we had a freeze. On it went and then just, you know, this year was renewed for another decade. So you're talking, you know, 25 years of 3% increases. And meanwhile, we have, you know, a few years of making lower level increases that are not going to close that gap. Especially because we we started from a lower baseline. The US has invested in science and scholarship for a long time, being weak on the humanities, I will say, but they have such a tradition of philanthropy that various foundations and individual benefactors have helped support the humanities to a meaningful extent. President Trump continues to make recommendations to cut the budgets of NSF and the NIH and Congress and the Senate on a bipartisan basis, vote through major increases. The result is that NIH, for example, is funded, you know, over $40 billion. Divide that by 10 and you get 4 billion. And look at CIHR, which even after increases isn't that much north of a billion, we have a massive challenge to be competitive in this country. My concern is not with the government's, you know, credibility in terms of having taken real steps and having made a commitment, but rather with whether there's an understanding in Ottawa, and certainly in the provinces which have done nothing to compare with what the German states do, that we really still aren't fully in play.

So that doesn't mean that all decisions being made are not based on evidence, but certainly the ones that you've highlighted, are not based on evidence and I think that's a real challenge. You know, I think, you know, people become part of a team, and it's that team mentality, and all of a sudden, like, everybody's on one team, and they're against the other team, and all of a sudden, everything the other team did was wrong. You know, like, it happens very quickly. I mean, there's lots of psychology studies to show to show that, but that's the emotions, you know, coming through and those are the emotions that are guiding people's decisions, versus, you know, versus the evidence.

And you know, I think, because right now it's a political appointment, the politicians really have to want to have a Chief Scientist. The last government really wanted a Chief Scientist, and they spent a couple of years figuring that out. So it was really like a long and in-depth endeavor, not just to find one, but to sort of lay the framework for what the Chief Scientist would do. So I think you really need to want to have that, the politicians really need to want to have that. And I don't know how to make science less political, because I'm not really political. And I don't think science is political. So I'm not sure why people think it is political, but I think it's that the misuse, it's not the misuse of science, it's the misuse of what people are calling science that's the problem.

I would also say that something that's important is mental health, having that funding available either to provide more sources for mental health counseling on campus, as well as having the opportunity that if you take a year, a gap year, off, still being supported financially while you take that decision.

So any possibility of missing out on talent is something that needs to be considered very seriously.

So we really want to be sure that we're creating environments, we're creating workplaces, we're creating career pathways, that allow people with talent, with ability, who wants to make contributions, to have access and to be able to contribute. And so we know that there are barriers that exist; we know they're structural, they're systemic, they're attitudinal. We know that there's racism, and sexism, and homophobia in society and academia is a reflection of that and so we know that those barriers exist, and we need to get those out of the way so people can bring their full selves to work and make their full contributions which benefit all of us.

So it's a little bit different from what universities maybe are more used to which is competing with each other - they're really competing with with themselves to be better than they used to be. So it's about holding up a mirror to themselves to look to see where are they missing policies, processes, programming around equity, diversity, and inclusion. What do their demographics look like? Do they know themselves - and they have to get to know themselves and do a thorough self assessment, collect data on what the institution looks like - and then identify gaps, or identify barriers, or identify systems that perhaps need to be adjusted or changed or gaps that need to be filled with new programming, to address inequities, to address barriers, to address issues that are preventing full participation. So it's really self assessment. It's raising awareness. It's becoming educated about what the issues are and what works. It's about developing an action plan. So following the self assessment, institutions develop an action plan to address what they've discovered about themselves and then measuring that so two years, three years, whatever the decision is, out from the self assessment and following the implementation of the action plan, they should be able to measure and see whether it's working or not. And if it's not working, then that's information - that's data - and it allows an institution to pivot and change and say, well, that's not going to work, we're going to stop doing it. Because we, particularly around EDI issues in this country, we tend to, we keep doing the same thing over and over again, thinking that we're going to get a different outcome. The same things that we're doing over and over again, are things like it's a pipeline issue. So if we just keep focusing on girls and keep telling girls to #ChooseScience, that somehow that's going to change things without addressing the issues in the climate and culture in the context, which are the things that dissuade girls, or people of color, or people with disabilities from actually participating.

You know, that's why we have professional actors. You know, I mean, maybe they're not talking about what they do every day, but they know how to engage the public or we have professional musicians. These people know how to put on a show, and really to engage the public you're putting on a show. But I think the other challenge is science is complicated, you know, and it's how do you distill what you've spent decades trying to understand or trying to advance, how do you distill that in a way that is engaging - you don't dumb it down, nobody wants to be talked down to - so you still need to be true to what you've done, but you can't use all the jargon that you commonly use? So I think it is a challenge. It is a challenge for anybody, you know how many people in accounting are asked to engage the public in what they do? I mean, I think people kind of just know, I think the challenge for science, it's kind of a mystery to most people, like what we do in labs. And so I think it's an opportunity to bring people into our world and I think that's really exciting, but it is really hard to do it well. Things have changed a lot over the past say 20 years, or maybe even the past 10 years. There's some fields, you know, that are really good at engagement, and it's just part of their training. So I would say astrophysics is one of those or astronomy. Most of those graduate students do a lot of public engagement and so they've become, whether they go into academia or industry, they've honed their skills over time. And there's other examples as well. But most of us don't, as you know. Having said that, I think there are more opportunities for students and even for Professors to get better at that engagement.

It's one thing to do your research, but you have to be able to communicate it beyond, whether it's to other researchers to policymakers, the public, your family, and so on. So honing your science communication skills will pay dividends in your regular research life. In terms of science policy, well, all the research that we're doing is publicly funded, so the public deserves to know what's going on in the lab, and they deserve to see your output. And similarly, if your research can help shape policy decisions, or provide an input in decision making, then you should also be able to understand the science policy landscape and provide input. So I would say that graduate students should at least explore science communication and policy, to have an idea of what the fields involve, build those skills and try to implement them where they can. But no one student can do everything, so it's kind of a relationship we have to work out how much science communication, science policy you're okay with."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "57:44", "text": "We asked Dr. Shoichet about her challenges and successes in science communication.

They might have great memories, but it's still something they stopped when they were in grade 8, you know. And so, I think the challenge we face is, again, those preconceived notions of what science is. What we've done is we've taken a tangential approach to engaging people in science and that is through art. So for example, at Pearson Airport, there's an exhibit on three of the bridges in Terminal 1 where there's just beautiful art on the wall. And if you look at it from far away, you might think \"Wow, those are you know, those are pretty colours, or those are flames or snakeskin or\", but as you approach it, and if you read about it, you'll realize, well, those are actually stem cells or retinal cells, you know, that's actually biology.

So, from early on in her term as Minister, Dr. Duncan emphasized the need to think about how to support independent fundamental science. The concept of a panel rolled out - she was in touch with me about chairing it. And we worked together on the composition of the panel, tried to make sure we had reasonable gender balance, and mix of research intensive and regional research universities, and of course, the disciplinary balance as best we could. I don't think we hit a perfect disciplinary balance, we had three people with a physics interest and we were light on the humanities. But it was certainly broader than many panels have been that have looked at things in the research space. So, pretty wide angle commitment on the part of the panel."}, {"speaker": "Marija", "time": "3:55", "text": "The FSR publish their report in early 2017, but suggested improvements in the budget were not implemented until the following year.

The minister's diagnosis was one that reflected the community's perspective. It was a fabulous panel, amazing experience to work with them. But the community was also very engaged with the panel process and you know, affirmed exactly what they've been saying to the Minister. Namely, we had a shortfall in funding. The peak had been reached many years earlier, really early in the Chretien period of the so-called innovation agenda. Science funding per capita had fallen and we were seeing a squeeze on the next generation, which, of course, badly affects equity, diversity and inclusion, because of the shift in the composition of the research workforce, with a much more diverse pool of individuals undertaking graduate studies and entering the junior ranks of the profesori. So, bad news for diversity with the squeeze on funding. And, more generally, you know, we had an imbalance in terms of applied versus fundamental research that had emerged. And they were across the board matters of concern  -the instability of the budget of the Canada Foundation for Innovation. That infrastructure was supported on a somewhat unpredictable and spiky basis, the graduate student and postdoctoral suite of supports and not being refreshed or reviewed for many years, big concern with the growth in the pool. Some of the career awards had been pulled back that the granting councils offered, which meant there was more reliance on the Canada Research Chairs. Well, you know, they were introduced in 2000 and had no further renewal of funding. In fact, in the Harper era, because logistics meant that some number of them went unfilled, instead of managing the logistics of the approval and application process, which you know, involves basic queueing theory and some thought. The Harper government took that as a chance to clawback 350 of the chairs. So there were missing chairs even against the 2000 that were initially planned in terms of the budgeting, side effect of leaving spots unfilled quite a number of them. So there was, everywhere we looked, signs of a certain amount of neglect a certain amount of lack of investment. And we heard that in great detail for the research community, which was enormously engaged with our process in 2016-17. And, of course, findings reflected all that and a series of recommendations to begin to bring us back into play to restore a competitive footing for Canadian independent extramural research. Finally, I would say is we were at considerable pains to emphasize it was about the entirety of the research realm. This wasn't focused on STEM, we invoke the French \"Les Sciences Humaines\", to highlight that the humanities were very much in play here, that we were talking about scholarship in its broadest sense, and we were also concerned with what we saw as a life cycle approach. So we were thinking about from the graduate students at the masters and doctoral level right through to senior scholars. What suite of initiatives, including administrative and governance changes would put Canadian science on a footing to improve its prospects for, you know, the next decade or next generation. I think the financial recommendations were actually prudent and modest, they were not aggressive. They were really benchmarked very carefully against early high water marks. And so in putting it all together, I think it was a blueprint to get us back on the road to being highly competitive. And unfortunately, though I think tremendous progress has been made, the government really has fallen short in both the speed and the final point of investment so that we, I think, are recovering, but we still need a serious infusion of resources to get fully competitive in the years ahead."}, {"speaker": "Zeynep", "time": "7:56", "text": "As mentioned, in recent years, there's been more emphasis on Applied Science, sometimes called Translational Science, in the health setting.

He explained that thinking about potential impact on human health is a good way to build engagement and interest in scientists' work."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alan Bernstein", "time": "8:31", "text": "In a democracy, at least government represents people, people pay for our science. So it's not surprising that people care about how their money is spent. And so, what do people care about? Well, for sure people care about diseases, right? Everyone cares about their health. So they want cancer to be solved even more specifically, they want the cancer that affects them the closest, whether it's themselves or a loved one, they want that one to be solved tomorrow. Right, we're all getting older so they want dementia to be solved and Alzheimer's and, you know, neurological disorders to be solved, mental illness, heart disease... I don't think that's a bad thing. I think that reflects an interest of the public in health and an understanding that you need research to solve those problems. If we are going to argue for science, with our politicians and with Canadians, we need to relate it to them and to the issues that they face. And it's not an argument to a fundamental research versus applied. It's an argument about the importance of research and knowledge to create new jobs. So there needs to be an interlocker between the public and the scientific community, which is, I think, in a sense of what people who run these agencies and certainly what I did, their role is to, in part, explain to parliamentarians, who are representing the public, that sometimes the shortest way home was not a straight line. And that's where fundamental research comes in. To me the question: \"is it interesting research?\" And will it be research that eventually that will have impact? Impact on science, impact on people. That to me is the right question. And, it's a funny thing about science, but the best science has impact on science and on people. The questions on a grant application that ask that question, I don't think should be used to decide whether you get funding or not, unless it's an RFA, unless it's a strategic initiative. To me, the main purpose of that question is to force the person who's writing the grant, to think about that question. So again, I'll go back to, this is going back a long time, when I wrote my postdoc application to work on chicken tumor viruses, avian tumor viruses, I was asked that question: What is the relevance of human cancer? So the honest answer is: I don't know. Right? Who cares about chicken tumor viruses and humans, right? On the other hand, it made me think about exactly this question. By and large human cancers are not caused by retroviruses, certainly not by avian retroviruses. On the other hand, the mechanisms by which these viruses cause cancer can be completely different. If you think about it, in hindsight at least, then how humans get cancer, how many ways can you get cancer? So viruses, again, I have the benefit of hindsight. What these viruses do is capture human genes and they're mutated and they're a hook to getting into how human cancers work. So what I wrote 50 years ago in my postdoc application, was that the mechanisms by which these avian viruses cause cancer in chickens, is probably going to be shared with how human cancers arise.  Not the actual virus themselves, but the underlying biomedical mechanism, that turned out to be exactly right. It's not that I'm brilliant, at all, but it's just obvious when you think about it. So it did, it did force me to think about it. I never quite believed what I wrote, to be honest, but it forced me to think about it. And I think we all should have to think about how we're spending public money."}, {"speaker": "Zeynep", "time": "12:24", "text": "Dr. Naylor worries that Canada is still lacking in science culture and observes that in the US, the National Institutes of Health have been very successful in winning broad support from the US public and lawmakers, with per capita funding three times greater than its counterpart, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research."}, {"speaker": "Dr. David Naylor", "time": "12:42", "text": "It comes back to science culture.

Now, in the case of the US, I would emphasize that NSF, the National Science Foundation, has a per capita funding rate that isn't much different than NSERC.

The number one thing, and probably the number two thing, is you bet on people. Good people, great people, by definition, do great things. So I really focus on the caliber of the individuals who want to do a particular project. Because in the end of the day, it's that's the most important thing. I think secondarily, you pay some attention to, is this a really interesting question? And it may not be obvious, especially if it's outside your own area, it's an interesting question, but if a really smart person, a really good scientists said I would like to work on x, then, even if my initial reaction -I'll personalize it- is, why would you want to do that? On the other hand, \"jee, I really have a lot of respect for that individual\", so then I'll do a little bit of thinking and reading about it and \"Oh! Now I get it.\" It comes down to, again by definition, good people do interesting things. So you bet on good people, even when it's not obvious to you at the time, that it's going to be an important question. I don't like either/or decisions. And so when you're running an organization like CIHR, you need a a fundamental core of researchers doing a lot of work, a lot of great research. So that's, you know, the open competition as it's called right at CIHR. I also think the right kind of strategic initiatives, that are addressing more immediate or obvious issues, should also be part of the portfolio, sort of a diversified portfolio. A lot of people in the research community will argue when success rates are so low, that money should not be used to fund strategic things. On the other hand, a well written RFA, Requests for Applications, in the strategic areas, allows for a lot of really, really good fundamental research. And the best way to convince politicians to give CIHR more money is not to frame it as, \"we're only going to do fundamental research. We're not gonna do anything that's relevant to Canadians,\" is a big mistake.

Stefania spoke to Dr. Orli Bahcall, a Senior Editor at Nature Genetics, to hear more about how they choose which articles to accept for publication and what they think will have a strong impact."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Orli Bahcall", "time": "18:10", "text": "Assessment of manuscripts are all subjective. Our assessment of the advance of a work is always subjective. And we are here as editors of really as part of our community to help and support our communities in different ways. And one of that is through the peer review and publication of manuscripts. And the things that we work for, you've mentioned a few of them, in assessing manuscripts is the novelty and the advance and the contribution to the field. But all of this fits within the spectrum of what, as editors, we're looking for within our journal and how we're looking to represent our field within our journal. And so we do this on a broader scale. We're looking, while we're reading each manuscript and we make our assessment of each manuscript as a journal or as a team of journals as we have across Nature journals. We have very regular assessments where we do, just like we're doing here with a strategic planning meeting, we do our own strategic assessment. And we keep track of our fields. And we keep track of what work is going on. And the new trends and really exciting new areas that are developing. And this is the part I love the most about my job is the fact that we get to keep track of all this. And we discuss within a big team at Nature, I work with a team of 18 editors in the Biological Sciences team. And we meet together and we discuss what are the most important areas and we each represent our fields. And we have discussions about how we represent that and what areas we want to represent and what our standards within each area that we should be looking for. And write our own strategic review about how we're going to do that. And all of that, which we do a couple times a year, and we update as we go along as well, that it really is the major thing which informs how we assess manuscripts. So each manuscript that we see, we are reading it to understand the manuscript and what was done and the level of advance, but as an editor, we're fitting that into the context of what we're looking for to represent as a journal. So as an editor, when we're doing our regular assessments, if we say the word impact, what we're really looking at is not citations, but we're looking at what do we as an editor think is the impact of this work? And that's absolutely something that I talk about a lot. So the impact of the work I will usually be talking about, is this study going to really change something in my field? And change something in my field, it might be something like a resource, I mentioned the UK bio bank is just transforming human genetics research as we know it. And so that is one of the most impactful papers that I've published in the past couple of years. And that's because it does transform how we do human genetics, because it's providing a valuable resource. And so it might provide a resource or it might have findings or analysis that shifts the way the field is done or just questions some theories and makes people re-evaluate it. I can consider that is very impactful, because it's something that will be widely discussed in the field and makes people re-evaluate some of the theories. Impact -I often talk about if it's something, I'm asking how is this working to be used. So it's impactful if it's something that lots of people are going to be reading. And it's going to inspire, it might be a very initial result right now, but it's going to inspire a lot of people to do follow-up work. So, you know, there are many different ways to be impactful, but we're really looking at impactful as something that people are going to read, people are going to talk about, it's going to have an influence within this field or other fields. Another good way to be impactful is because maybe, you know, within my field of genetics, it might be something that's quite commonly known, but it's really translating this to the next step. And we've been talking a lot here about genomic medicine and translation... So impactful is translating things into the clinic. And so they're very different ways when we're talking about impactful and Clinical Translation of genomics, there are many different ways to look at that. So every manuscript has very different types of questions that we will look at to try to talk about that."}, {"speaker": "Zeynep", "time": "22:10", "text": "Dr. Bacall also discussed the consultation system in place that nature to try to find the right journal to fit an author's manuscript."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Orli Bahcall", "time": "22:17", "text": "I think the most important advice I give to authors when I talked to them, is to keep in mind that there are many journals out there. And all of the journals are doing the job of representing the way they feel is appropriate for their journal or is their set of journals and understand that there's a fit for everyone in a place for everyone. And that's something that, at Nature journals, we also try to help out our authors as a service even more, because we have a whole set of journals across the Nature family. I try, and all the editors at the company try to find the best home for any manuscript that's submitted to us and we do believe we have a good home for any manuscript. And so the way we do that is, you know, when I talk to authors out some interesting work, and they submit this, if it's not a good fit for me, I talk to my team. And we'll also talk to editors across our office, across many other journals that are relevant, and ask who's interested in the manuscript. And I think that's been one of the most interesting process, we've developed this, what we call \"consultation system\" over the last five years, to really expand it and make it a lot more available and accessible for all of us. And I think that's been the most interesting experience because as a group of journals at Nature, we're really able to work very closely together to understand all different aspects of a field and how different journals can represent different areas of a field really well. And within that refer a manuscript that is very good, technically, but may have a different angle. We can find different journals will want to represent that in different ways and we can offer authors different options have different journals to go to."}, {"speaker": "Marija", "time": "23:57", "text": "An important part of science is replication.

Negative result can be a positive result if you spin it right, finding a lack of association can be incredibly important, finding lack of support for theory that was assumed to be true can be incredibly important. So it's really in how you decide and frame it. I look for that just as much as any other kind of paper and I absolutely have published some great ones like that. And I think we do, we do look for that just as much. You may not see it, maybe depending on how its framed, but I think there's incredible value in that... of publishing negative results. I think I'll, you know as I said, all journals have their own approach. And they're really looking for how to represent their fields in the best way at their journal. So I think everyone has a slightly different approach. I don't think it's as clear cut as some might think is we do where we don't publish negative results. It's really we look for the we look for the best in the paper, we look for what it contributes to our field. So I just don't see that kind of dichotomy. But what I think a little separate from a negative result is that the idea of replication and following on papers, as well. So there is a lot of interest in just pure replication studies from a manuscript and how we represent and publish those. And those can be incredibly important. And very often, they can contribute a lot, but they're not enough to warrant publication in the same level of journal, or in the same journal and difficult for that journal to find enough space. And we've definitely had that issue of we get a lot of replication of studies that are not actually questioning or changing a publication and we can't give it a full publication itself, but we see a lot of value in collecting those in some way. And I think that's something this field is still working with and across our journals, we still discuss for how to best do that. I think things like pre print servers have really been a huge help having these more available in biology. And posting pre prints can be great. We also have comments fields on all of our articles, so authors can post the pre print, add comments and link directly to our papers. But we definitely do look for more ways that we could aggregate that across and link it more directly to the original publication, which is I think, would be a good direction for publishing."}, {"speaker": "Zeynep", "time": "26:48", "text": "We've talked about how science is funded and how it's published.

Dr. Bernstein, their president, told us more:"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alan Bernstein", "time": "27:16", "text": "So CIFAR is a fabulous organization, it's Canadian-based, global organization, research organization, where we build communities, we bring together some of the top researchers from around the world, including Canada, of course, around a question of importance to science and to humanity. We convene this community. They meet, you know, a couple times a year for five years renewable, and what we want is, ultimately and ideally, a whole new way of thinking about a really important question... transformative way of thinking about it. So we're not primarily a funder of a search at all, we're a builder of global communities. We're not bounded by geography, we're not bounded by discipline, or not bounded by questions. So we have problems in the social sciences and we have problems in the biological sciences in life and health, we have programs in quantum materials, quantum information science, astrophysics, a new program in geophysics, and we invite anybody in the world to come forward with an idea for a new CIFAR program. And what we require is that it be a question of importance to humanity and to science. That it be of the nature that it's a great CIFAR program. So if you want to identify all the genes mutated in autism, it's the kind of work that Steve Sherer does, for example, it's a great project, but it's not a CIFAR question. That can be funded by CIHR. I'm not saying one's better than the other, it's just we have a different niche in the ecosystem of research. We're interested in bigger questions, more broader questions. So, just to give you a good example of one: brain, mind, and consciousness. What is relationship between our brain and our mind? We can't write a CIHR grant to solve that problem. That program led out of Western Ontario has got about 20 to 25 people in it, from philosophers to molecular geneticists to cognitive psychologists, psychiatrists, etc. Who are meeting to discuss that question. So they don't need to do experiments, they need to discuss, to wrestle with such a huge question. And so we invite proposals in any area. We don't say it's got to be in the brain, it's got to be in geophysics, or it's got to be in disease, could be in anything. We could have a global call, that's targeted. We've talked about it actually, we might one day. So you know, you could have a global call on the environment, or whatever. But so far, they've been open calls. So it's got to be a CIFAR-type program, great leadership, global. We don't require the things be interdisciplinary. On the other hand, we believe that our contributions to the research ecosystem is to bring together people who normally would not get together.

And that's something when I was a graduate student was not as much the case. I think there there are differences in cultures and that's something that's really important when we work together as scientists, but there's always the focus on the scientific method and the results. And I think that crosses borders, we all have good things that we can learn from each other. So if we want to just compare one thing currently in genomics between the UK and the US and Canada, too, and it's something we've been talking about this meeting would be establishing resources that are invaluable for a field and for the progress of genomic medicine. And we've been talking about the need for population cohorts, establishing population cohorts and ensuring that these have genetic information and now whole genome sequencing is the hope. And we talked about the UK biobank, which has really become the primary model, the leading effort in this and it's becoming, you know, the most invaluable resource that has really shifted all of human genetics in the past couple of years. I mean, it can't be underestimated. Just the value of that having establishing the UK Biobank and providing the open, fully open access to all researchers has for human genetics and human health. And the idea is to then model that in other countries, so the US has an effort with all of us, and other countries are establishing by banks too, but are further behind.

We want to, I mean, we do represent the best research from anywhere from anyone and we are, vut we're not fully blinded, right? We're not blinded to who the authors are. We have looked at models where they are double blinded. So I've read manuscripts where, say the author list is removed and commented on that, we've all as editors, we've all done this in certain times and done trials, and how that affects our editorial decision or how they were fixed to review process. And we see that doesn't really effect us. As editors, we really only care about the, you know, publishing the best in science as we should. We also offer at Nature journals we offer what's called double blind peer review. So authors can select during the submission process to have a blinded reviews such that the author, author list, and author information is removed from the manuscript. And so it is the editors will still see the author information, but the referees will not. And we've done this now for several years and across Nature journals, it's available to anyone who submits. And from those who opt into that and their manuscripts set to review. We see really no effect both on, whether the manuscript center review at that journal, or what the final decision is. So we don't see any actual impact on it. And as quite rightly so because we don't believe that it does have any impact. What we do look at also is the submission rates, which you alluded to the submission rates, and where we get the best research and how well it's presented. So we do try to do more outreach in areas that we feel are underrepresented, that may not know, just submit to our journals, or don't know quite the process or not feel as open doors to that or may not have easy access to editors. So that's something we care a lot about. And we will if we realized there's really good work going on in an area or a lab that is just not submitting to top journals,we will go talk to them and do more outreach and visit with their labs and maybe give seminars about how to work on their papers and how to prepare a paper for submission and how to talk to an editor and all these things I'm talking about with you, and try to help them work through the process.

And since then many other journals have launched and shown the ability to have these models. But as you know, there's still the question of what is a viable business model? And that's something that all publishers really do struggle and are continuing to struggle to figure out. What is a business, a successful business model to allow this to happen? And I don't think any, I've never seen anyone who actually questions the idea between making the research finding and the data sets and the access fully open and available and that's something that we all would like to see. Something at Nature journals we very much support, having the openness of the methods and the data sets and analysis behind manuscript, but the the final publication, there still needs to be some business model for us, something all of us do work with. You know what, I think one of the things that we do offer a Nature as you said, we do have a number of open access journals. And we've increased this quite a bit over the last few years, to give authors more and more options for publishing in our journals within fully open access journals."}, {"speaker": "Marija", "time": "39:22", "text": "Dr. Bahcall continues, explaining her support of pre prints, which are full drafts of research articles made available online to the public before formal peer review and publishing in a journal."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Orli Bahcall", "time": "39:35", "text": "We also support pre prints more and more. Nature has always supported preprints for over a few decades, starting back when it was mostly only in physics, and I come from an academic family, with two parents in astronomy, so for me growing up, pre prints were the norm. In astronomy, pre prints were how the communication of research happened. And the journal publication happened quite a bit later. So that for me was very normal. The norm was you pre printed your work as soon as it was done everyone in your field read the pre print that week and discussed it and gave you feedback. And then, you know, once you collect the feedback and figured out what we were doing and reassessed, some point later you would submit it to a journal but it wasn't that big a deal, that wasn't what made your career at all. So that was the norm that I knew for my family. So for me that was quite natural when I became an editor one of the first things I talked about when I started was, \"why are we doing more of these preprints? Like why didn't biology have taken this on yet? Why aren't we more open in the communication?\" I was very excited when that movement happened. Very excited when biologists started to take on preprints more and more. And Nature itself was one of the first publishers to adopt that, by launching its own pre print server, it was called Nature Proceedings. It was a full preprint server at Nature, that lasted for a few years, and we were able to work quite closely as an editor is able to work quite closely with some of them in looking at how we can best use the pre print service for authors and use it to develop manuscripts that were under review so that authors might submit their pre print, post their pre print there, while also submitting to Nature journal and going through the review process, and using the comments they received on the pre print thoughout the review process. We looked at models for how we could integrate this better with the review process, that were interesting. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite the right time for that as a company and it didn't, it closed a few years, but I think we learned a lot from it. And since then other by archive has launched and it's done an amazing job for biology and has grown more and more and it's been become an incredible resource. It's widely used and which we all use, I use daily as well. And as a publisher, and most of the big publishers have now supported bioarchive and Nature, we've always allowed pre print servers and said very clearly that this will not negatively affect any editorial decision for consideration for research manuscript. But now we actively encourage it, we work with our archive to make the submissions easier. And I think it's really important to encourage pre prints for authors. Because this is really part of getting your work out there. And I think the way people communicate their own research has shifted from a time where, where you presented this at a meeting, and there's lots of travel and that's where you got your main feedback. More and more now, that's not happening. You know, even if you do go to conferences, they're only so many conferences you can go to. The main communication that we see today is through pre prints. And I think it's a great way, so this is why I encourage this, particularly for younger authors too, is to post a pre print and take some time to collect your comments on this and really ask people for comments in the preprint before you submit your manuscript. And I think its invaluable to get the work out there as early as possible and to get feedback and learn from that."}, {"speaker": "Zeynep", "time": "43:19", "text": "Another strong consideration when publishing is what we call the 'impact factor' of a journal.

So the Impact Factor defined by ISI is a measure of this level of citations of a journal through a somewhat complicated algorithm. It is the most common metric that's used to measure the citations of both the single manuscript publication and journal publication overall. And there hasn't been too many metrics that's become as widespread as that, which is why it's still the most widely used metric. I'd like to talk about this because, from what I see, it is authors and often authors from certain institutions or certain locations that really are driven, have a lot of pressure to publish in journals with a certain Impact Factor. And so there is a lot of focus on that from the author's perspective to try to achieve that. From a journal perspective though, it's quite different, which is what I think people should really recognize. From a general perspective, we don't actually talk about that kind of impact factor. We see that as one metric that is quite commonly use. And that's very easy, you know, provided for us. It's useful because it is provided every year and it's kept track of, and it's easy to compare.

There are some people for religious reasons or for reasons that are not, to me nonsensical, that don't, but most people still do. Does that mean we don't have to engage with the public? Absolutely not. So I think it's really important for everybody in the scientific community, especially, especially young scientists, to engage with the public. And I think a couple things on that: One, I've heard people say yeah, \"we need to educate the public\". No, no, no, no, no, they're not an empty vessel waiting for their brain to be filled up with all this great knowledge that we have. That's a clear -the surest way to turn them off. We need to engage with the public. That's number one. Number two: There's lots of ways we can engage. So for example, when I was much younger, the Canadian Cancer Society, I was getting money from them through the National Cancer Institute of Canada, would ask me to go to Sudbury. I remember once going to Sudbury to give a talk about cancer research. I always said yes when I was asked. I felt it was my obligation. So I was getting money from them from donors, volunteers who were going door to door knocking on doors. So I would do it. It's amazing what you learn as a scientist, what we would take for granted about what people know and what they don't know and what they care about, is completely different than what I would have predicted. Third, for people who receive money from, let's say, you know, CIHR. That's taxpayers, that's parliament. That money comes as a vote from parliament. So when you get money from somebody you should say \"thank you\". So my message always is, especially the graduate students, and to postdocs, to young trainees, and to young investigators, is if you are supported by CIHR, you should write a letter of Thank You to the Minister of Health. The letter can have three paragraphs -it's very easy. Paragraph one, \"Dear Minister of Health, my name is Joe Blow. I am receiving funding from CIHR for a project called, you know, blah, blah, blah. Thank you very much. The reason I think this grant is important to Canadians is for the following reasons. If you happen to be in you know, if your labs in Toronto or in Timbuktu wherever you are, I'd be happy to show you around my lab and talk to you more about my work. Yours sincerely.\" Doesn't cost a penny, because you can send a hardcopy letter to Ottawa without a postage stamp.  Just address it, you don't need the address, Minister of Health Government of Canada, blah blah, blah. Ditto your own Member of Parliament, ditto the Prime Minister, ditto the Minister of Industry Science and Economic Development, and ditto the Ministry of Science. So it's in the same letter. And the cool thing is, especially for young people, it's a civics lesson, you're kind of learning about how government works. So you'll get a letter back. And you know, all the members of parliament are in their home writing this summer, especially because there is an election coming. So, you can easily book appointment to see your member of parliament. So I think the education of the public starts with the public and start with the people who represent the public, which are members of Parliament and the Cabinet and the Prime Minister. So I think we all have an obli- all of us, have an obligation to start engaging with them. By starting by thanking them. "}, {"speaker": "Marija", "time": "51:05", "text": "Dr. Naylor also emphasized the importance of engaging the public and building a culture that celebrates science."}, {"speaker": "Dr. David Naylor", "time": "51:13", "text": "I think there is a challenge in that this is a young country, we have had a tradition of excellent science in many ways. We have to figure out how to celebrate that without that becoming a way for governments to assume they've spent enough money because that's part of the game that's played, \"Oh, we'll celebrate Canadian science and now we don't need to spend any more if the next year, we've had a Nobel Prize or we've had a Wolf prize or something else, and goody goody, now we don't need to spend any more money yet\". That worries me. So it needs to be a broader thing about celebrating science, valuing it, and embracing it and seeing the need for further support. So the public presses the government, rather than the government trying to impress on the public that they're spending enough by celebrating. Politics is a very tough business. It's a contact sport. These folks have to reapply for their jobs every few years. They make decisions that are based not just on evidence, but on values or preferences and context or circumstances. And a lot of this is highly positional interest-based rather than being about finding common ground. It's, you know, orchestrated warfare in the trenches in an election and in legislature. So more and more academics are getting the fact that they have to do science communication, they have to do outreach, they have to try to inspire the very young generation and their teachers to carry the torch for science and scholarship. I think that's a very positive change that I've seen over the course of a pretty long career. It's quite different now than when I started out. And on the same point, although the term 'Knowledge Translation' has a lot of baggage in my view, but knowledge sharing, knowledge co-creation, knowledge collaboration, whatever we want to call it, that is also way more active now than it was a few years ago. And it's not all about innovation in the marketplace, it's also about working with civil society organizations and working to build community to build non-profits. So there's, so called, B corps, as a hybrid in between commercial and non-profit. So there's a much more varied array of entities with whom academics are working in 2019, then say 30, 40 years ago. I think that's all to the good. I think it's getting the message out, it's building relationships, it's building a culture of creativity and critical thinking and innovation in all facets of society. I do think that the non-profits are a big part of this equation on multiple levels. One is because many of the non-profit's support research, large number of them in the medical and health world, but also because some of the foundations that have been set up are supportive more broadly of science and scholarship. And I think their allies to be enlisted. It was very telling in the run up to the 2018 budget when the heads of several major Canadian family foundations came forward and wrote an open letter urging implementation of the episode report, that was a very powerful statement. So I think we have to activate those allies in the philanthropic community, in the non-profit foundations of various types, and see them as friends of research to the greatest extent possible. I want to put an asterisk up and say, sometimes these entities try to nudge the direction of research more than seems helpful. Sometimes they insist on matching in ways that I'm not sure is always constructive. So, you know, I'm not going to say that they're the answer to research funding shortfalls, we must have open untrammeled research funding, without strings, for the best questions and the best ideas to be supported to be pursued with complete independence by great scientists and scholars at all stages of their careers."}, {"speaker": "Marija", "time": "55:03", "text": "The cycle of research from funding to review to publication to engaging and sharing findings with the public, are all necessary components of scientific discovery and progress.

One of my good friends, her younger sister has struggled with, like, an eating disorder for like, most of her life now. And yeah, appearance wise, you could have no idea, right? Like you expect, in your mind, there's sort of this stereotype that it would be somebody who's, like, emaciated and very tiny, but that's not necessarily what it is. And also in your mind, you sort of assume it's always females, but I think it's actually more common in men than you would think it is.

"}, {"speaker": "Holly Dickinson", "time": "3:29", "text": "So first is anorexia nervosa, which is what we primarily treat in the inpatient program, so those that are restricting their intakes have significantly low body weight. They have other criteria: an intense fear of gaining weight, and then disturbance in perception of their own body weight and shape. And then there are subtypes of those with the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. So there's the restricting subtype. The restricting type doesn't engage in any episodes of binge eating or purging/laxative use. And then there's the binge eating-purging subtype. So, that individual will have recurring episodes of binge eating or purging/laxative use, over exercising, as a few examples. And then, there's bulimia nervosa. So that's binge eating, which is characterized by both eating an extremely large amount of food and as discreet period of time, having a sense of lack of control over the amount of food they're eating, and feeling like they can't stop, and then, there's usually a compensatory behaviour. So, that may be in order to prevent weight gain from the binge eating, so that could be in the form of vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, excessive exercise. And there are certain criteria that, in terms of, to be sort of diagnosed in terms of how frequently you do this. So you need this, binge eating would happen at least once a week for three months. "}, {"speaker": "Tracie Burke", "time": "4:56", "text": "Those are kind of the the main diagnoses that we see. We do not treat binge eating disorder here in our clinic. With the recent DSM-5, Holly mentioned in 2013 came out, there was a little reorganizing of the classifications, and so they grouped eating disorders and feeding behaviours together. And so there's a new category called otherwise specified feeding or eating disorders.

They outlined the official classification system for eating disorders as they appear in the DSM-5.

But for anorexia nervosa, I believe, it's virtually impossible to develop anorexia nervosa unless you have some genetic predisposition, because, for just about everybody else, your body's not going to allow you to starve it to the point where your life is at risk. There's something hardwired about anorexic brains that allow an individual to do that without, you know, typically losing control and beginning eating again. You can lose weight, but it's hard to maintain weight, so anorexics are quite remarkable in the ease with which they lose weight and in the ease with which they lose weight once they regain the weight. They just shed the pounds. It's quite incredible."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "7:10", "text": "Dr. Kaplan is a senior clinician scientist at the Center for Addiction and Mental Health.

You have to have an environmental trigger, which is true for most illnesses that, you know, we all carry risk for various illnesses. It could be heart disease, could be cancer; it doesn't mean we're going to get that illness. There has to be an environmental interaction with the genetic predisposition to actually cause illness. Bulimia is less genetic than anorexia, but there's still a genetic component, and the environmental factors are greater in bulimia and similarly for binge eating disorder."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "8:00", "text": "What are sort of the environmental stimuli that you see for those two, well for all three?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Kaplan", "time": "8:07", "text": "So we know one of the significant risk factors is having early childhood sexual abuse. That increases the risk, and that's about 30-35% of people who develop eating disorders have a history of that."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "8:19", "text": "That's across all eating disorders?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Kaplan", "time": "8:20", "text": "Yes, I would say it. It's stronger for anorexia and bulimia, but it also is there for BED, which is binge eating disorder. I mean, that's one environmental risk factor. There are many others. Being in an environment that focuses unnecessarily and unhealthily on weight and shape is probably another environmental risk. So, being a ballet dancer increases your risk for anorexia because of the environment; it doesn't mean it causes it."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "8:51", "text": "It's just sort of a trigger for people."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Kaplan", "time": "8:53", "text": "Yes, if you're genetically predisposed, you probably shouldn't be involved in competitive gymnastics, let's say, where being thin is actually a requirement to perform."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "9:06", "text": "Beyond these factors, particular personality traits have also been associated with the presentation of eating disorders.

It's a personality trait in particular. There's a new wave of literature, actually it's not new necessarily, demonstrating that perfectionism is actually multi-dimensional. So there's a lot of different forms of perfectionism, and something I'm really interested in is learning what dimension of perfectionism is more commonly associated with eating disorders compared to others.

"}, {"speaker": "Shauna Solomon-Krakus", "time": "9:56", "text": "So, there's many different theories. I think, in general, the theories would agree that there are more adaptive sides and more maladaptive sides. So, in general again, very various theories that have different ideas of what the dimensions look like. I think, in general, the more adaptive side is setting really high goals, striving for those goals, and more the maladaptive side is setting extremely high goals, and unfortunately, when those are not met, perhaps it's not the fault of the goal, it's the fault of the individual, and we see a lot of self-criticism, which can be linked with a host of negative outcomes."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "10:31", "text": "She also comments on comorbidities with eating disorders."}, {"speaker": "Shauna Solomon-Krakus", "time": "10:35", "text": "I think it would be hard to pinpoint exactly a common comorbidity. What I can say is, just like any other mental illness, it's rarely on its own. And so we certainly are seeing comorbidities with anxiety and depression. We've all seen OCD and PTSD and number of comorbidities; it'd be difficult to say specifically. I think everyone's experience is unique. I do think it would be fair to say that it's rarely on its own, just like any other mental health diagnosis."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "11:03", "text": "There are many common misconceptions by eating disorders. So we asked our guests to help us bust some of these myths that they've encountered in their work."}, {"speaker": "Candice Richardson", "time": "11:10", "text": "So I think a lot of the times, there's a lot of myths and misconceptions around eating disorders. A lot of people think that eating disorders, when somebody presents, they're going to be at low weight, and, or, and/or using purging, which often we see in media is self-induced vomiting. And those are kind of the only mental images people have of eating disorders. But really, you can't even tell by looking at somebody if they have an eating disorder or not."}, {"speaker": "Ary Maharaj", "time": "11:36", "text": "The first one that comes to mind, and Candice is going to smile when I say it, is that the health is weight and that weight is, weight's going to be there, and Candice made a face for the listeners can't see it, where, like a lot of people especially those who were in it, think that that number on the scale very much is going to determine what is healthy and unhealthy, and in the media, images that we see in the conversations that we have, for some reason, we don't treat weight like we treat height. We kind of all know that we're going to be kind of where our parents are at. And we have a range for that, and a lot of it is genetically set. But for some reason with weight, in the language we use in the conversations we have with friends and family members and the media, we're super judgy with it. We think that we can overly control it when we can't. And there is, we do have a set point, and our weight is going to be in a range and some of it we can't have control over. But I feel like, in society, one of the really big misconceptions that we think we can control that."}, {"speaker": "Candice Richardson", "time": "12:30", "text": "And another one that is very problematic and quite stigmatizing for folks who have experienced an eating disorder is that people think it's a choice, like it's a lifestyle choice. And it's not, because I can assure you as somebody who has experienced it and has spoken to many others who have and I work with these clients, if it was a choice, this wasn't the choice any of us would have made. So I think you can be really stigmatizing for somebody to hear that, especially when they are trying to seek help and assistance with this, and I think eating disorders can be confusing to folks, because there's a delicate line between where is this behaviour that's \"healthy\" or we're trying to be healthier versus where is this a mental illness, and I think that line to be really fuzzy, which I think can also make it hard as a parent or a loved one noticing these behaviours, like what is problematic versus what isn't?"}, {"speaker": "Tracie Burke", "time": "13:20", "text": "Who is the typical patient? I think that's a common misconception. Oftentimes, when people think about who gets eating disorders, they think about perhaps women, young women, maybe from an affluent family, and I would say that that stereotypical group is not true any longer. I see a lot of, we see a lot of women in their, in their 30s and 40s. Maybe, you know, they've, they've kind of had disordered eating their whole lives, probably fit criteria for an eating disorder, but never received treatment, kind of put the family first, and now the kids are gone, and they're kind of coming back to address their eating disorder, or they're realizing like that it's a problem that needs to be addressed. So, I think that's part of what I've seen in my, in my career; there's a bit of a shift towards women in middle age kind of coming for treatment. We've also seen probably a bit of an increase in men. It's still very infrequent, I would say for us, but we might have a man in our program five times a year. So the population's shifting a little bit. Yeah, and, and it really knows no boundaries in terms of socioeconomic status or ethnicity."}, {"speaker": "Shauna Solomon-Krakus", "time": "14:36", "text": "One that comes to mind first is that eating disorders do not just affect women. I think we're seeing eating disorders across the gender spectrum, and we are seeing it in across age spectrums, across different cultures. So, it's not, I think there is this misconception that it only affects women, and that is certainly not true. I think another big misconception is that you can tell someone has an eating disorder just by looking at them, and that is certainly not the case. We know that individuals across the body size and weight spectrum can experience an eating disorder, so that's certainly one we want to dispel right away. And I guess finally, another big one that unfortunately we still see on news feeds and in the media that we're trying to dispel is that eating disorders are a choice. We do know that it is certainly not a choice, that these are severe mental illnesses. And I think that is probably one of the most important misconceptions that we need to dispel as well."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "15:29", "text": "So, maybe we can shift now to Candice, your own lived experience and what you're comfortable sharing with us."}, {"speaker": "Candice Richardson", "time": "15:34", "text": "For sure. So, I think, the general disclaimer, like, of course, this is my own experience, and it's not in any way indicative of what others might experience. Like, I am a relatively able bodied and privileged to a certain capacity, white young person. So my experience isn't going to look like what a lot of other folks who have to navigate our system is, but for me, it started from a really young age. I was always very, very anxious, and I had stomach problems that never really went away. And all of we did the testing for, like lactose intolerance and all of that jazz, I was tested for everything and nothing really came back conclusive. And it only got worse as I got older. And so back then, ARFID, which is avoidant restrictive food intake disorder, that didn't exist back then, but that is probably what it would have been diagnosed with that that point, but things kind of perpetually got worse. And then, when I was in seventh or eighth grade, and I grew up in competitive dance my whole life, so that was a stressful environment. There's a lot of exercise involved; those were regimented. And so, the weight kind of started coming off, because I was doing that and was having a stomach ache so I wasn't eating. And it was kind of this perfect storm of issues. I was already very anxious and perfectionistic, and then people were noticing that I was losing weight, and I was receiving praise for it. And then, one thing led to another, and I ended up in not the greatest place. So for my, what I thought had happened was that my paediatrician became concerned, I was referred to a psychologist, and luckily my parents were able to pay out of pocket until I was able to access provincially funded treatment through hospital system. But there got to a point when I was seeing the psychologist that she just kind of like looked at me and my mom and was like, \"this is way beyond my capacity. I can't help you,\" like, \"it would not be helpful anymore,\" like, \"this is medically too complicated.\" And so then, I was kind of left in this weird transition between I'm too sick for one place but not sick enough. I went on a six month waitlist for hospital-based programs. And so after the fact, I found out, like years and years later, that my mom was actually the one who was noticing all these things that there's a problem. My paediatrician wasn't taking it as seriously as maybe she could have. And my mom had written essays and was like, \"please, we need help.\" And so that was what then finally, when my medical signs, my blood pressure was all messed up, my heart rate, things that were very problematic and shouldn't be happening in a child, was finally when the referral went in. But at that point, it was already kind of late in the game. So, I was, when I went to my first assessment, it was for family-based therapy. So my mom and dad, my sister, and the whole, we saw everybody; we saw the dietician, nutritionist, social worker, physicians, psychiatrist. It was like, I honestly can't even remember that day. And after the assessment, they were like, \"you really should be like a higher level of care to do, like day patient,\" or whatever, which would mean I would have to not be in school and all that. And for me, that was like catastrophic, and my parents were very like, \"no, we're going to do this at home,\" like, \"we're going to show up. We're going to be here for appointments. We can do this.\" But, it just, it can be really frustrating as somebody who's trying to navigate the system that, at the point, when I was referred, which was like nine months ago, I would have been fine doing outpatient treatment at that point, but I didn't actually get seen until nine months later, which now you're telling me I should be an inpatient or day patient. I'm too sick to get the service that I was referred to. So it was a bit frustrating, but luckily we were able to manage it on an outpatient basis, and then so I was in treatment for heavily for a year. And then they kind of like wean you off, like you see people less frequently, all of that sort of jazz. And so, by the time I was out of high school, I was mostly done with treatment. But obviously, it's not something that just goes away. And I think that's another very common misconception around eating disorders. And quite often, when we see people who are in the initial stages of recovery or who maybe did the treatment, and a lot of the times, the way that treatment is structured is that if you have a restricted type of eating disorder, again, eating disorders don't always involve weight loss, but when they do, you can't be in therapy. If your brain is not functioning, like cognitive behavioural therapy isn't going to work if you're, you're not cognitively there. So you kind of have to focus on the weight gain first. They call it weight restoration medically so that you can actually show up emotionally and work on the stuff that is causing this. But the problem is, quite often, when you're trying to function in a society as all of these things are happening in your personal life that you're maybe trying to hide because you're not comfortable disclosing this to everybody as it's happening, people see you when you were potentially at a very low weight, and now they see you and you \"look normal\". And like realistically, none of the emotional work has even began at that point that now. You have all the problems you had before, and you're in a body that's drastically different than you were in a few months ago. If you're like, \"oh, you look great\" in thinking everythings are fine. So, that's probably the hardest point I would say, because you \"look fine\" and you're no longer occupying this sick role that everybody's so concerned about because of your physical being, but emotionally, you're probably worse off than you maybe had been. And then, people start treating you like you're fine at that point. So that's kind of like a very murky water to navigate. I don't blame people for thinking that way, because, of course, when something is physical like that, you think like, \"oh, but you physically look better.\" So you are better, but that's the complexity of an eating disorder, because It's a mental illness, but it very quickly can become physical, and the physical effects of it are really just a side effect. Yeah."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "21:07", "text": "Do you think the role that stigma plays in in just the manifestation of eating disorders, like does it, has that changed over time in like how did affect you personally?"}, {"speaker": "Candice Richardson", "time": "21:20", "text": "I think, for me, and I think to, like, it's something I think about a lot, because I was like a kid when this all started happening, so I think I wasn't fully aware of the role that stigma was playing, but I think talking about it with my parents after like now that I'm in this like quasi-practitioner sort of role, not quite yet, but I think for them, too, it was hard to convey to others what was going on without them being judgmental about it and to really, a lot of the times, people don't have a full understanding of what an eating disorder involves. Dinner time in normal households is probably pretty normal. You sit around a table at dinner time in a household with somebody, a child, with an eating disorder is like going to war. It is not, I can't even do justice to the amount of stuff that goes on and the emotions and the fighting, and, and it's really, I say this to parents on the helpline a lot, I'm like, \"this isn't your child.

So I started, I graduated U of T Medical School in 1978 and started my residency in internal medicine at the time. And one of my first rotations was on a gastrointestinal unit, where a lot of people with inflammatory bowel disease and other disorders were being intravenously, nutritionally rehabilitated. There was one patient on that unit who didn't have inflammatory bowel disease, but nobody seemed to know what was wrong with her. And I happened to go by her room one night when I was on call and heard her distress. She happened to have been vomiting, and I went in to see if she was okay. And she proceeded to tell me her symptoms and then more of herself and her life story, and I surmised, even though I hadn't ever seen a patient with anorexia nervosa, that this was what she had. That year that I was in internal medicine, she happened to be the Chief of Medicine's patient and became clear to me he wasn't sure what to do with her, and she primarily had a psychiatric illness, and so his office would call me every few months, maybe once every six weeks, she would have a visit with him for an appointment, and he would call me down to talk to her. I didn't realize it at the time, retrospectively, I was establishing some form of psychotherapeutic relationship with her that she began to trust me and began to reveal aspects of her history that, you know, kind of explain how she came to have such a serious illness. So, I mean, that was an interesting experience for me, not that I knew what I was doing at the time, but you know, it pointed out that the non-specific aspects of being an empathic physician, listening carefully, being non-judgmental, being open to hear what people have to say, are very important in establishing trust."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "24:48", "text": "Dr. Kaplan's experience led him down the street to an eating disorders unit that's now part of CAMH, where one of the world experts in eating disorders convinced him to switch from internal medicine to psychiatry.

Dieticians, Tracie and Holly, also acknowledge the importance of incorporating the psychotherapeutic component into their practice at the Eating Disorders Program at Toronto General Hospital.

So generally, what happens when you look at the patient journey: someone is referred by their family doctor to the program, and then they have a consultation with a psychologist who will more thoroughly look at their diagnosis and just what the best kind of treatment approach would be, and then they would, depending on on that outcome, the patient would either go directly into the inpatient program or directly into the day treatment program. And so, in the inpatient program, we have 10 beds; really, that program's meant for individuals who are a little more medically unstable. And they kind of, in the early stages of normalizing their eating, they might need a little more medical surveillance to ensure they don't go into repeating syndrome or have any other complications associated with the repeating process. Generally, the length of state that they're looking at in the inpatient program would be about six to eight weeks, and then they would come to the intensive day treatment program, and they would likely be there for probably another six to 10 weeks. And then, once they've completed that, then they would go into the relapse prevention program, which is individual CBT for relapse prevention where you would meet with a therapist for 15 minutes initially twice a week then moving to once a week for 16 sessions, and then they're discharged back to the community."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "27:11", "text": "When Tracie mentioned CBT, she is referring to cognitive behavioural therapy.

So they may stay an impatient for perhaps a couple weeks and then transfer to day hospital.

So, we work with a message that all foods can fit and all foods should be incorporated in moderation. And we do that; we provide balanced meals for our patients, oftentimes in the initial stages of normalizing eating, and for people who are in intensive treatment. They are working to incorporate avoided foods, and so when they're doing that, they might have to work harder to incorporate those avoided foods initially. So, in intensive treatment, someone that can only have a piece of cake in a really disordered way might have to practice having that in a normal way. And so, you might see more of that happening in the intensive phase of treatment, just because they are trying to kind of normalize that into their lives. And we call this food exposure. The idea is that the more they kind of incorporate these foods, the more they're able to start to tear apart some of the thoughts about the foods that maintain the eating disorder as well as start to reduce some of the anxiety that might come with eating those foods. So exposing yourself to things that cause anxiety during treatment is really important, because that's how we get at the underlying cognition and help people to kind of rewrite some of that stuff.

I really like, it pains me to say it, but I'm not. When I was in high school, it was hard enough fitting in, and now kids these days, not only do you have to discover who you are, you have to build a brand and advertise that and hope that's accepted by your peers. You're throwing yourself out there not just to your peers, to the world. And, you know, now you can quantify popularity, which that can't be easy at all.

But I guess at this point, it's Instagram. You just see what people want you to see. So you really have no idea what's actually going on behind the scenes. And I would say that our exposure to the influencers of social media also makes a big impact because a lot of them are very fit, beautiful people. And that emphasizes how important that is. And even to be successful in that sort of industry, you do have to sort of meet those standards to fit in like that. So I'd say like, your exposure is just even more so than it was before. And even just like how much you can't really escape from school and your peers and maybe all the pressures that you're facing from them when you go home, just because it's like all around you on social media. And honestly, if you're not on social media, it'll have social impacts and that sort of thing. So there's really no way to, like, isolate yourself and be like, \"no, I'm not gonna, like, I'm just against it sort of thing,\" because then you'll miss out on other things.

Shauna, Candice, and Ary weigh in on how that can impact eating disorders."}, {"speaker": "Shauna Solomon-Krakus", "time": "33:05", "text": "Social media is certainly a very powerful way to depict a life that perhaps isn't a realistic picture of life but the idealized picture of life, and unfortunately, a lot of that time, that's centred around the body and appearance. And so I think it's important to continue talking about how these images are altered and how it's not a realistic depiction of what the body looks like every single day. In research, we see the term inspiration quite a bit when we're thinking about social media. And this is the idea that individuals are striving to achieve this thin ideal that is defined by different cultures. And now, we're seeing in social media this idea of inspiration, which is starting to be studied more in research, which is essentially this idea of maintaining and achieving this thin and fit body, which is slightly different from before, it does show. I think how social media can perpetuate these ideals that men and women are facing that are typically unrealistic and only apply to a very small percentage of the population, though it's really hard to disentangle and to know if somebody is experiencing like disordered eating or exercising in a way that is not as adaptive and not as healthy. It's really hard to tell that apart just based on a single picture on social media. So, it can be really dangerous for someone who is struggling with an eating disorder to be on social media and see these images, because it is perpetuating those ideas that can be quite central to the eating disorder."}, {"speaker": "Ary Maharaj", "time": "34:40", "text": "Especially in this last decade, because I always forget social media and its modern form came out in like 2007, so like, in terms of like, human evolution, it's come out in a very short period of time and had a lot of impact. And, I think this, the psychology behind it and the science behind it is very much, I'm still waiting for, like, high-end, high-power, like, applicable research on it. But, what we have seen is that there is increased body dissatisfaction, generally speaking, and people who use social media more, especially Instagram as a visual social media platform, because there's theories behind it on, like, whether it's like that self-comparison you're making where like before, maybe like 50 years ago, or even actually like 20 years ago, and Candice and I was like, we're a kid, we kind of had to worry about it in terms of like TV you'd compare or like magazines, but it's a little bit harder because you can turn those things off. When we have our phones with us all the time and Instagram is a quick thing that you're just scrolling down, that body dissatisfaction and those negative self-comparisons you end up making repeatedly can happen so much more often that, neurologically, you're firing that synapse; you're like Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going, becomes a really easy pattern to kind of repeat over and over again. And, it's why we see it as, it shows up as a risk factor for eating disorders and body dissatisfaction as a whole. And then like, we see the proliferation of diet culture on social media very often to both in the form of what we see traditionally as laxatives and then ideal bodies or muscular ideal bodies but also in like the way sometimes exercise and fitness, or sometimes that multibillion dollar industry can sometimes make people feel like that's what they need to do to have their body look a certain way and can be really combined with dieting. NEDIC is in full support of joyful movement for people; we think physical activity is wonderful, and every Canadian, every human should have equal access to participate and the opportunity to in their life to participate. But we should do physical activity when your body feels good, and you are listening to your body and it's joyful, and it's social, and you're doing it with friends, and not the rigorous kind that you're going through pain and your body screaming at you, because we're not all going to be elite athletes and we all don't need to maybe be doing the rigorous kind. And we're, we have to be, I think, as a field, a lot more conversation with our friends in diabetes prevention and obesity prevention and all that stuff, too, to have a unified public health messaging on this topic, because we don't want now the public to get really weird misconceptions about like, well, like they're telling me to exercise and we're not doing enough and like these people now are telling me it's too risky. We, I think, we all think exercise is good. Like, let's, like, we all think is eating is good.

And, I think this decade has seen some headway as we've seen broadly with mental health but also with eating disorders. But, I think there's still so much left to do and so many communities who are way more underserved that I don't want any kind of padding on the back to make us think that we're, we're there yet, because I think we still have a long way to go.

Work is being done to unify that, but to a client who's in it or a family member who's trying to help, that can be really hard. So, our support workers are there to help with that. And then, the other big component that we do is our outreach and education piece, which can involve our bi-annual conference. It involves our workshops in schools in community settings, and we're working with youth with health care professionals who unfortunately haven't maybe received the do training to be as eating disorder-informed as they could be and also the loved ones and caregivers who are looking to support folks that's mainly based in the GTA right now. But I've connected with folks across the province of Ontario to kind of do more on that on a provincial level and hopefully, inform things like Eating Disorders Awareness Week, which happens at first week of February 1, the seventh every year, that's national with other eating disorder organizations to really do public health education on the topic."}, {"speaker": "Swapna Mylabathula", "time": "41:01", "text": "Fantastic.

So, we go into kind of in the Toronto area and the camps and do body pride with the kids who are there, so focusing on like activities that foster self-esteem, literacy, and things like that. We also, I quite often, I'm the one going into high schools and really challenging kids to think critically about what we see in the media, and like, how does advertising work, and what about Photoshop, and what are the resources available, and things like that. But, we also do a lot of work with educators. We have Beyond Images, which is a plugin turnkey curriculum for grades four to eight that any teacher can access through the network website that really tries to build in that piece that's missing in our curriculums about body image, media literacy, and things like that.

Doesn't mean that physicians know what to do with patients. Believe me, it tends to be a secret illness. Physicians aren't going to find out somebody's bulimic unless they ask the questions. Most physicians are uncomfortable asking those questions. Binge eating disorder patients tend to be obese, so they come to physicians, but the physicians tend to focus on weight loss, which is what the patient's asking for.

We're always happy for folks to call in or chat in over a website and kind of guide them through that conversation, because it can be really tricky.

Sometimes you feel like this person is sick, and we're going to hold an intervention, and we're like, \"okay let's hit the brakes a little bit there and, like, unpack some of this,\" because intervention, like, yes, that is a show that exists, but quite often, that's not really effective. For folks going through this, they're going through a lot to begin with, and to be kind of over targeted all at once by everybody, they care about their life, and it can actually cause a lot of defensiveness, which is already something that's really, really common among folks with eating disorders. So generally, we encourage people to come from a place of concern and, you know, not necessarily pointing out things of like, \"oh I've noticed you've lost weight,\" because that can cause a lot of emotional issues.

So that, they could already have their support systems and their family or anything like that and just not want to be out to the whole world about it, and there is a certain level of privacy and autonomy that we have to respect, but generally, being kind of encouraging and letting them drive how they see this moving forward, because a lot of the times, we go into well-meaning, thinking like, \"Oh, I want to take you to help,\" but like, help may look different for somebody or somebody that might be seeking like hospital-based treatment for somebody else that might be seeing a therapist once a week, or like, there's different ways that people might want to approach recovery or that might be appropriate for them, given their life context."}, {"speaker": "Ary Maharaj", "time": "46:20", "text": "And, that's why that being patient is so important. And, I can understand how hard someone who's supported many people with mental health issues across the board, I think that patients can be really difficult because you are frustrated and you see this happening to your loved one.

So, if you come from a place of patience, and you're like, \"I'm noticing these things,\" like \"this is how I'm here for you,\" this, these are some potential options, almost like if you're fishing; you're casting lots of bait, and but it gets up to the fish to take the bait. And that's like what Candice is talking where like they're the fish and they will take the bait and it'll be there. But always making sure that, that bait's there and remembering that a person is more than their eating disorder, too. So, you can still try your best to do things with your loved one that they, they do love.

So you mentioned you have a couple of clinical trials that you're trying to."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Kaplan", "time": "49:15", "text": "Yes. So, we've just finished a number of studies. We did a large drug study, and it's very hard to do drug studies on people that are anorexia; they're not that compliant. And you know, especially a drug where they could gain weight, they tend to drop out of those studies, but we really focused a lot on compliance in this study, and we were successful in recruiting and involving over 150 subjects and five sites in North America."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "49:43", "text": "And so, what was the, what was the study looking at?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Kaplan", "time": "49:46", "text": "It was looking at the effectiveness of a drug called olanzapine. Olanzapine is drugs, and psychiatry are very much dose-dependent. They have different effects at different dosages. So at dosages, used high doses, olanzapine is an anti-psychotic, and it is used to treat schizophrenia. At lower doses though, it's not so much an anti-psychotic as it is an anxiolyric; it reduces anxiety. And we felt, because it works primarily through dopamine, a neurotransmitter dopamine, now, dopamine regulates areas of dysfunction that we see in anorexia, mood, for sure, activity. So the classic disorder of dopamine inactivity is Parkinson's where there's a loss of dopamine cells in the substantia nigra, a different part of the brain reward - so anorexic patients are anhedonic; they get no pleasure from the things that are typically human, in the human, pleasurable, food, sex. In fact, it's hard to create a situation where an anorexic will take a drug like cocaine, because they just don't get the same impact. Cocaine works and is so addicting, because it releases dopamine in the brain. And dopamine has a role to play in that, too. So because of all that, it's seems to be involved in the core symptoms of anorexia nervosa, you know, the weight loss and the restriction of calories are a result of those dysfunctions."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "51:08", "text": "and you did see an effect."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Kaplan", "time": "51:10", "text": "We saw, we, in a subgroup, not all subjects, a subgroup seem to have a therapeutic response by allowing themselves to gain weight without completely getting so upset that they dropped out. So for them, it was a therapeutic weight gain, they described less of a drive to exercise; you know, typically, the people with anorexia are driven to exercise. They described much less anxiety. They described less feeling of body image being large and being bloated and actually talked about enjoying meals, right? Because for most anorexics meals are aversive. Yeah, they don't get pleasure from having a steak dinner."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "51:51", "text": "And, you said the response was in a subset, but in an area where there are virtually no treatments, "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Kaplan", "time": "51:57", "text": "It's significant. The another remarkable finding in that study is, if you gave that drug to other patients, even normal people, healthy people, you would get changes in blood glucose. It can induce a type-two diabetic state; you get increasing lipids and cholesterol. We didn't find any of that in the anorexic subjects. Their Lipid, cholesterol, and blood glucose didn't change. And, when I've talked to people who, let's say work with those, you know, people with schizophrenia, that, they found, they saw that as quite remarkable. But there's something in the brains of anorexics that make them somewhat impervious to these kinds of negative side effects, if you can get a positive effect."}, {"speaker": "Yagnesh Ladumor", "time": "52:44", "text": "If you're interested in learning more about this study, Dr. Kaplan and his group recently published their findings in the American Journal of Psychiatry.

But of course, that's the ultimate goal. And from there, I also wanted to see, there's also emotional experiences that can be often precipitating factors to an eating disorder symptom. And so, wanting to understand, \"are there specific emotional experiences that are more commonly associated, say with eating disorder symptoms, compared to others?\" so we know how to tailor treatment, we know what specific traits and emotions to be looking at."}, {"speaker": "Stephanie Nishi", "time": "54:51", "text": "Eating disorders are not just about food.

In some cases, some people come for treatment once and can walk away and not really have to deal with their eating disorder in a, in a big way for the majority of their lives, but that's, I would say, that's the minority. And so, we see, we certainly see a lot of people who are dealing with an eating disorder as a bit of a chronic disease, looking at how to, how to live with an eating disorder. You know, many, many people come to treatment more than once. So we always talk about recovery as a bit of a journey. And so someone, depending on their life stage, who's supporting them, the environment that they're in, their motivation to change, the readiness to change, they might come in and do a piece of work and then live their lives for a bit and realize they need to come back and do more work. So we do have kind of, you know, an open door policy around who can come how many times, and we, we kind of appreciate that it is a bit of a journey and that people might come back to do another piece of work. So, treatment is oftentimes just the first step in, in a larger journey. And really, the hard work for many people come when they've left treatment and they're integrating back into their, their normal life where many of their stressors might be, and there are environmental cues that might kind of trigger some of their old coping behaviours related to the eating disorder. "}, {"speaker": "Holly Dickinson", "time": "56:41", "text": "It can be easily discouraging if sometimes treatment doesn't \"work\" the first time or doesn't feel like a fit for you. I think there's the door, like the idea that the door is always open, never to give up, and we've seen some individuals come into treatment, and, and have one sort of dose the treatment and recover and move on with their lives. And then we've had experiences with individuals that have been sick for many years. And then for whatever reason, they are able to make that change and, and, and stay well.

We're gonna introduce ourselves and I'm going to kick it off. So I'll ask each one of the panelists to introduce themselves, two minutes, as to who you are, how you got here, and how you use AI in your research or in your your everyday life if you're not doing research. So I'll start off with myself. I'm Allan Miranda, I'm head of JLabs Canada as was mentioned. JLabs is the incubator facility forJ&J in the Mars complex. We as J&J are in medical devices, consumer products and pharmaceuticals. How do we use AI as J&J, we're using AI largely as an enabler of our business. In the pharmaceutical side of the business, we're using it to help discover targets, identify patient populations, in the medical devices part of our business, we're using it in visualization, again, to purify patient populations to give us a better understanding of the individual patient. And in our consumer products business, we're using AI as a digital tool to help us in retail to understand patient behavior, to give us insights into how patients interact in the store, and to give retailers insight how they can better use our products, help us on the supply chain. So myself here running the incubator, I will admit, though, I have a science background, in vivo pharmacologist, I see AI being applied largely in the drug discovery space. And so we have a hub of technologies or companies here within JLabs that are using AI as a drug discovery tool. So I think what I spend most of my time internally is trying to convince my research and development colleagues of the value of the companies that are here in Toronto and helping them understand what's unique about the AI companies here, so over the last, I'd say 15 months, I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but I've become pretty knowledgeable of what the practical application is of AI, and how that can help certainly a pharmaceutical company be successful or be more successful. So that's me and I'll turn it over to Dr. Das."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Sunit Das", "time": "3:36", "text": "I'm Sunit Das, I'm a neurosurgeon at St. Michael's Hospital just down the street, and a scientist at the Hospital for Sick Kids. Both my clinical practice and my research work focus on brain tumors and caring for patients who have primary brain tumors. My own work in AI is relatively limited on the practical side. I am a collaborator in a large group project, using machine learning to try to identify different radiographic biomarkers of response and early failure for patients with brain tumors. More fundamentally, my interest in artificial intelligence has come in the field of ethics. I have worked with the assumption that medicine is going to be moved by AI and that AI is going to be part of medical practice. And that being the case, as a physician, I felt it critical to think, what does it mean for our field for AI to be a part of it? And how does that affect the way that we think of ourselves as physicians?

I'm Allison Paprica, I'm the Vice President Health Strategy and Partnerships at the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence. So you've just heard from Marzyeh, one of our core faculty who focuses on health at Vector; Vector is not exclusively about health, but about a quarter of our scientists do health all the time and then other scientists have interest in health as well. Collectively we've grown to become a community of over 300 people, including students, post grad affiliates, affiliate faculty, all focused on artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning in particular. Interesting that you say ethics, and of course we got ethics up there, I am not a computer scientist, I'm a chemist by training, I began my career in the pharmaceutical sector, then I worked for the provincial government for 13 years. My last position there was as the director of the Planning, Research and Analysis branch at the Ministry of Health and long term care. And for the last five years, I've had deep involvement in our national strategy for patient oriented research. So one of the things I'm personally interested in is public involvement, social licence, and how we make sure that the AI we apply is consistent with the values of the public we serve.

My name is Chris Hammill, I'm a programmer analyst at the Hospital for Sick Children. I work on studying neurodevelopmental disorders in children using Magnetic Resonance Imaging. My training was in statistical ecology where I used what is now machine learning and AI based tools for looking at ecological problems. I got more interested in uncertainty quantification, and kind of more traditional Bayesian statistics. And I moved to Toronto to work on neuro imaging, and I'm actually working under Jason Lerch, who was on the previous panel. So I'll be a semi technical anchor."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "6:22", "text": "We'll need it. So you know, in the last panel, we talked a lot about how clinicians would use AI and probably conveniently we didn't have any clinicians on the panel. So I think, Dr. Das, it's going to fall to you to sort of give that clinicians perspective. But when you think about AI, you said you're using it now, not so much in your basic research, but more in your clinical practice. What excites you about it? And then from an ethical perspective, where do you have concerns?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Sunit Das", "time": "6:49", "text": "Well, I'll say I think we had a very nuanced discussion with the first panel, and I'm going to steal from Miriam that I am fundamentally a professional advice giver. I've educated myself and been educated in given tools that allow me to assist my patients to make good decisions. And I see artificial intelligence as simply a tool that might refine that ability. The nuance was also made on the previous panel, that the weight of that decision still lies in a communication between myself and my patient. And that may be nuanced by what I'm able to offer as a consideration based on what an algorithm might tell me. But it's still a human decision between two people."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "7:34", "text": "AI does promise democratization of data and decision making. So I would ask you as a clinician, how do you now if, you have there's always been decisions for tools in medicine. And AI we could look at as decisions for tools on steroids. How do you reconcile those decisions for tools, with a patient who's also coming now with a certain level of awareness and understanding of what a diagnosis should or could look like? "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Sunit Das", "time": "7:57", "text": "Well, certainly, I mean, I'll say as a physician, and I think this is pretty well known, everyone consults Dr. Google before coming to see the doctor. So there's already some element of that just intrinsic to practice now. One of the interesting things I'll say about AI, and perhaps one of the ways that physicians have miscomprehensions of what AI will bring, I think many of us feel that AI is going to give us certainty, that we're going to be able to say to our patients, here's a binary. And I know which of these binary decisions is right and which is wrong because of what an algorithm tells me. And I think it speaks a bit to the fact that many of us as physicians really don't have other than an intuitive grasp, a really practical idea of what statistics are. And if you think of AI as being kind of a very organized and very mature statistical modeling approach, I think it's going to give us an opportunity to learn more about how we make decisions, how we help patients make decisions. But I think we may as a field be disappointed to learn that we're not going to be given approximations of 100% and zero."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "9:05", "text": "Okay, Allison, you've looked at, in your ministry of health role, you looked at health from a population basis. And now you're working at the Vectror Institute where you're dealing with companies in the health space; you've also got a focus on health. So what do you see as the promise for the individual patient? What's the benefit for the population? And what are some of the - you raise the ethical concerns - what are some of the ethical concerns you wrestle with at the Vectror Institute or want to apply research methods to to understand?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alison Paprica", "time": "9:31", "text": "So I'll answer the question just with a few examples that I think get at the points you're raising, because, you know, as has been said many times, AI is a tool and there can be many different applications. But you know, when I think as myself or someone close to me who's in hospital, I think one of the things AI can do in the short term, is do a much better job of managing the data that are all around us right now. So we don't have all this data in healthcare because we wanted data we have it because we didn't want paper processes anymore and the data is kind of like a byproduct that is mostly just going into the ether. And with AI, we have the potential to bring together data, data of different modalities and turn it into signals that are actionable that I think can provide benefits, you know, even in the short term. At the population level, since we're talking about the future, I'll go all the way to my dream of a better understanding of multimorbidity. You know, we still divide diseases into you know, here's your heart disease, here's your depression, here's your hypertension. And we know that's not how people experience them. And I think we can start to imagine a world where, especially if we use population wide data sets, like we have here, as unbiased as they can be, we can get insights that lift us all up, redefine disease and have benefits, yes, at the personal and at the population level. You'd asked about the ethics."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "10:47", "text": "The ethical issue, so you said that you wrestle with that at the Vectror Institute and that's our focus. So what's the focus? And where is that research going?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alison Paprica", "time": "10:53", "text": "So I have a long standing interest in what I call ethics and values. And you know, I defer to people like Jennifer Gibson and Gillian Hadfield to speak with precision about the ethics. But my general view is that for the kind of change that we have the potential to have, it's really important that we work with the public. There are things that we can do, but what should we do? That becomes the question. And for me, the heart of this is we have to start communicating with them in non fantastical ways, right? It can't be, you know, the Terminator, and data from Star Trek The Next Generation. We need to be getting more and more examples of real applications out there, and engaging with the public in genuine ways about the ways in which we can turn their data into knowledge, what they value what they agree with."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "11:40", "text": "Is there a gap in health literacy with patients to help them have that conversation? Or will that be part of the process?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alison Paprica", "time": "11:46", "text": "I think that's part of the process. I personally believe it begins with plain language. So you can have genuine engagement at a large scale. And I think it's challenging. I mean, not only is AI complicated to explain, but even what happens to your health data, when you go to the hospital or go to see a doctor. We have this joke in the health data community that it's about 15 hours before people really understand what you're talking about. And frankly, what they want to talk about is their own health record. When you say bringing data together, they're thinking about their own care. So we got a long way to go. But I actually think it's essential that we go there with the public with clinicians with traditional health researchers, you know, it's gonna be as good and strong as it can be if we go there together."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "12:27", "text": "So Chris, Allison raised the question of, there's an opportunity with the existing data sets. Let me ask you a question, as somebody who's in the healthcare system, looking at those datasets, what's the quality of the data presently? And can we make good predictions on the data that we have, and what's the opportunity to improve?"}, {"speaker": "Chris Hammill", "time": "12:42", "text": "There's really a big spectrum of data quality when you work in the healthcare system. Some of it is incredibly well organized and you can really make inference quite quickly on those datasets. But some are quite disorganized. So it's very difficult to harmonize across different research institutions, particularly on what they're acquiring, what their key dimensional variables are. These are hard problems that I think are working on being solved."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "13:07", "text": "The panelists will come back to this idea of data set variability a little bit later, when they discuss consented versus unconsented data. "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "13:15", "text": "We have a company in our space Pentavere, which looks at data sets and tries to put them into rows and columns, which sounds really boring. But as they say, to me that that's the fundamental work in actually making prediction. From the hospital systems perspective, we talked a little bit about ethical considerations or risk. When you look to the future, so say we get our datasets to a point where they're of high quality, what are some of your concerns, from an ethical perspective? What are some of the opportunities, and what are some of your concerns, probably more appropriately?"}, {"speaker": "Chris Hammill", "time": "13:42", "text": "So I think the first panel spoke very well about what many of the key opportunities are ahead of us. As Marzyeh said, there really is a huge capacity in models now that we really didn't have before. So we're able to distill information in a way that historically we haven't been able to, but it comes with many risks. So Marzyeh said that these new AI tools shouldn't be held to a higher standard than our old tools. But I would argue that they should, because they're so much faster and the potential risks are so much higher, because they can apply to more people. "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "14:14", "text": "Allison."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alison Paprica", "time": "14:15", "text": "I just want to weigh in, because sometimes I get concerned when we talk about the risk of AI, we always talk about the negative risks. And and the truth is, it's like the ship that never leaves Harbor, right? The data are an asset that can be used. And if we only focus on negative, negative, negative literally we'll miss the benefits. And so as I'm talking about risk based frameworks with a number of people, I like to bring forward these examples like Anna Goldenberg, our associate Research Director, health senior scientist at Sickkids. She's got a model, it's still in research setting but with Dr. Lawson at Sickkids, you know, they're taking data from the pediatric ICU, and most of the time, they can predict five minutes sooner when a pediatric patient is going to go into cardiac arrest. There's not really a downside, right, we've got another fellow, an affiliate who's working on detecting when someone comes out of a coma, there's no downside, the person will still come out of a coma if the model is wrong, right. So we don't want to be so risk averse, that we're not making progress in these areas, that, if we can put it this way, are really low risk of harm to the people. Because I think those are the spaces where we're going to have a lot of learning that we can then extend into areas where there might actually be more risk to the individual."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "15:28", "text": "Allison cautioned that we may be overestimating the risks of artificial intelligence, particularly in cases such as the ones that she described. We can use what we learn from implementing AI and low risk settings to inform future implementation of AI, that might might merit more ethical consideration."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "15:45", "text": "So I work on the business side. So we, in business, we say there's a cost benefit. So how much cost am I gonna expend and what's the benefit? So from a clinicians perspective, working in the hospital, where should we be expending the cost or our efforts? And where will we see maximal benefit from your perspectives? "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Sunit Das", "time": "16:02", "text": "So, you know, I think it's worth reiterating what the first panel said that there are multiple types of AI's, and it is a bit difficult to talk about AI as a unified entity. We've talked so far about AI as a data processing system, basically a way of finding patterns in large data sets. But you think about something as simple as what your company is using, an algorithm that can just parse from neutral data, and create categories in something as simple as having a device that could be scribe for you, so that as a physician, you're looking at your patient during your time with them, rather than sitting on a computer writing into your EMR, could have remarkably transformative effects on the way that we function as doctors and the way that we interact with our patients. It seems like a simple thing, it's not as sexy as I think what we usually think of with AI, but it's a place where something perhaps relatively simple could actually have a big effect."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "16:59", "text": "So that gets to a question of, in the practical world, or in the wild, as they say, the artificial intelligence wild, what are some of the things that need to happen to make this real for you as a clinician and for patients? So in the hospital setting you see today, what needs to happen from an infrastructure perspective, what needs to happen from a training perspective, or an education perspective to make these things come, even the simple things you talked about simple, relatively simple, come real?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Sunit Das", "time": "17:23", "text": "I remember being at a graduate seminar, I want to speak to Chris here, I remember being at a graduate seminar about 10 years ago, that the Dean of Engineering from my University came to, and a bunch of us in the equivalent of IMS at my old University, and he came to us and he said: \"I'm from engineering. I have answers, I need questions.\"."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "17:45", "text": "Sounds like an engineer."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Sunit Das", "time": "17:49", "text": "My suspicion is that if we were to canvass physicians, we could find multiple pain points, as simple as this one of having a scribe, that could be places for intervention. I think, again, the analogy that was used in the first panel, that AI is going to be something that makes what we don't want to do easier. I think that's probably a good approach to think about how we could interface meaningfully in medicine."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "18:16", "text": "What Dr. Das is trying to say is that AI can sometimes be mistaken for something expansive, and revolutionary. But it doesn't always have to be that way. It can be as simple as having a system in place prescribing patient interactions, something very simple yet transformative for the way that physicians interact with their patients. But how do we go from idea to execution?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "18:36", "text": "So Alison, I work with a number of companies who have solutions for the healthcare system, many using AI, but they don't have the relevant experience to understand whether their tool is actually valuable in a clinical setting. And then we have a lot of hospital AI tools that are being implemented, but they're being done in a pilot way. So what you have is industry, which really knows how to scale but doesn't know what they have is valuable. And you've got academics who are developing things that are incredibly valuable, but don't know how to scale. So in a hospital setting, how do you bridge the divide from a systems perspective to make it work?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alison Paprica", "time": "19:06", "text": "Well, it's a complex problem that doesn't have a simple answer, but the simplest thing I would say is health AI is team science, right? done right? No single group is trying to do this on their own, the company has something to contribute, the clinicians have something to contribute, the patients have something to contribute. And it's worth putting the effort in upfront before you jump into implementing any solution. I did want to mention actually, yesterday, we announced publicly on our Vector website, the first in a series of Pathfinder projects that very much take this approach. So the very first one is with St. Mike's hospital and Vector is contributing machine learning expertise. But the whole thing is clinician led with sort of data science and AI in support of the clinicians. And that's the general model we're going to see and to the point of, you know, where do you go, you start with things like that, that are very practical, that have low risk of doing harm that are done in a really rigorous way. The other thing that you might start with is technologies that are mature in other sectors but might need to be adopted to work in the health sector, like a chatbot, that might be actually more helpful for patients than trying to sort through information in a PDF and figure out what's relevant for them. So we shouldn't go, we go to kind of the equivalent of the trolley issue, right? And we shouldn't, because no one actually wants to drive the trolley into a pedestrian. There are things that we can do right now that are helpful, and we should be working on them as teams."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "20:26", "text": "So if we make these investments correctly, where do you see the future going? And what types of infrastructure needs to be there to support it or education?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alison Paprica", "time": "20:33", "text": "Well, I'll just say briefly, I mean, people often think of data, rightfully, they think of data, right? And that's fine. And we should all plan on making investments in data, we have to decide as a team, what's going to have the right combination of ease of implementation and impact. And people shouldn't underestimate the need for high performance computing, too. Because a lot of times, we'll have people from hospitals coming to us saying we've got this great data, it's not cleaned, and then there's no access to high performance computing resources. So it's not really a starter. Those are the first things our faculty asked about. And then the trick is doing it at scale, and not just provincially. But doing it across the country, internationally."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "21:10", "text": "And of course, none of this is possible without the input and participation of patients. Getting approval to work with patient data isn't easy and requires research ethics board, or REB, approval and patient consent. How do we ensure the confidentiality of these datasets?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "21:27", "text": "There's some questions on the panel before about hovering on the edge of patient ownership, patient confidentiality, where does Vector, what are some of the things that you're wrestling with - and Dr. Das you can jump in on this as well - what are some of the clinical things that concern you with respect to patient confidentiality or patient data?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alison Paprica", "time": "21:45", "text": "Do you want to go first?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Sunit Das", "time": "21:46", "text": "So I do think that de-identification takes care of many of those concerns. I'd actually stepped back a bit and say, it's worthwhile for medicine to realize the value of these data sets. And it's interesting, I think, in medicine, we often think, what can AI bring to us? And I do think it's going to require partnerships and true teams. And it's critical for us to think what can we bring to development. And part of that is data that we've accumulated, part of it is expertise and ability to understand what sort of questions need to be answered."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "22:23", "text": "So do we need to collect more data, or do we need to do more with the data we have?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alison Paprica", "time": "22:26", "text": "We probably have enough data that we could be generating some really high impact insightful knowledge, if it were cleaned and prepared and, you know, harmonized. And so that's where the question comes about, you know, where to put the work. Just in terms of consent, I did want to mention, you know, a major challenge is that we know, and generally the way the world is going is, we're going to have some really rich consented datasets. In some cases, people may not 100% realize what they've consented to with the device, but they will have consented. The real issue when it comes to population health is that the people that are not represented in consented datasets, these tend to be some of the most vulnerable people in our society. They're the ones that are already affected by the social determinants of health. And if we blindly follow the knowledge we gain from consented data sets, we'll be actually doing a disservice and likely growing inequities in society. So consented data sets, yes, 100%. But to always know, they don't paint the full picture."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "23:28", "text": "The nuances of patient privacy was something our audience also had questions about."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 1", "time": "23:32", "text": "A question I have is about de-identification of data. You know, there's some debate about, I think we agree, that anonymization is not necessarily privacy, and even cross referencing data sets. So I just wondered about whether you'd comment about the issue of partial privacy? Michael Kearns at Penn, if I'm right, so he's coming out with a book on the ethical algorithm and talks about adding noise into the sample, and then if you have a large sample, you don't have as much noise needed, less noise. And then the second question realtes to, do you feel that people have a right to own their data and get permission to use it? Like, I think the GDPR, which was referenced earlier, I think is ahead of where we are in North America. And I think it's just the beginning. I listened to a person from Google DeepMind say that, \"listen, give us regulation, because then if you have a car that is very fast, you can at least know how to innovate within the speed limit. But if you don't have speed limits, you go very slowly, because you don't know where the cliff is.\" "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "24:32", "text": "So who has who feels comfortable to answer that question?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alison Paprica", "time": "24:36", "text": "I'd like yeah, on GDPR, I'd like to make the point that we're actually, we've just submitted a manuscript on this point. I mean, the focus is on individual control and consent, but it still allows some non consented uses. And the reason I want to use this of nonconsenting data, I want to emphasize that because I think if we mislead the public and we think that it's all within their control, and then we do things for example, epidemic monitoring, you know, we risk losing trust at exactly the time we're trying to build trust. In terms of de-identification, we're actively working on it. You know, Marzyeh has been a big driver for what we're trying to do in this field. And the general stance we're taking is, where the standard approach to de-identification would be small cell suppression, that doesn't work for machine learning, you need record level data. But we have enough data, you know, maybe we can take a very small sample, and still get to that very low re-identification risk threshold on maybe tens of thousands of individuals, and have a data set that we really could get out there to students, to many people."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "25:41", "text": "But she said, we're behind the US. So where specifically are we behind? And where could we stand to catch up?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alison Paprica", "time": "25:46", "text": "She's referring to, you know, the mimic database in particular, which is, you know, she'll joke, it's the most over studied population in the world, it's tens of thousands of people from ICU primarily in one hospital, though, it's expanded to include other sites. So we do not have any facility to do that in Canada right now. And it would be against our privacy legislation, and possibly against social licence, we don't know. We do, on the other hand, have the advantage of having a relatively small number of really sophisticated players when it comes to data management. Ministry of Health is a very sophisticated player, ICES, the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, has existed for more than 25 years, holds data for the whole population. Vector is partnering with them. So it's kind of working through the nuts and bolts, but the general approach would be, you've got consented data, let's make sure it's really consented, right, and then you've got - with much tighter controls and real care taken to ensure that we have social licence and build and maintain trust - things that you do with data on the whole population, because the consensus will always be a subset of the whole population. I hope that answered the question."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Sunit Das", "time": "26:54", "text": "You know, there is an element where ethics depends upon right action, and a expectation of right action. CRISPR holds within it the risk of morally corrupt behavior, whole genome sequencing, by its nature, there's the risk of identification of individual subject, these things are intrinsically coded. And we depend on behavior among each other that respects some domains. I don't know that that changes with AI."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alison Paprica", "time": "27:26", "text": "Nope. I think maybe one of the things that's new with AI is, it's been said by others, you're not just giving a data set to anybody, you're giving a data set to people who are extremely skilled at finding relationships and patterns and maybe piecing together information in ways that most people couldn't. So I think there's going to be heightened sensitivity around re-identification risk with appropriate control, but at the same time, lives can be improved with the knowledge that we can generate from that data. So how do we balance that with all the stakeholders involved?"}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "27:58", "text": "To quote Spiderman's uncle with great power comes great responsibility. Like with anything, we need public policies that maximize the benefits of AI, while minimizing its potential costs and risks, rules and regulations are the foundation of a healthy market? Where do we start? "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "28:14", "text": "From a regulatory perspective or principles of AI, I'll say, an organization like Google has actually published their AI principles, which are kind of an update of principles they've had in the past. Chris, maybe I'll ask you the question. Do many organizations have those same principles or adhere to those principles? Will we see some sort of regulatory framework where companies will need to have those principles or adhere to some sort of universal standard?"}, {"speaker": "Chris Hammill", "time": "28:36", "text": "So I think that this is actually increasingly becoming the case. For example, the American Computing Association recently published algorithmic guidelines. In Europe, there was GDPR, which was all about data fairness across the board, not just medicine. HIPAA came up in the discussion in the previous panel, and we have pHIPAA. So I think more and more people are starting to take these questions seriously, which I think is very important."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Sunit Das", "time": "29:01", "text": "There's an editorial in the New York Times today on legislation that's being introduced into the US Senate, basically to mandate companies that use artificial intelligence driven algorithms to incorporate concerns of privacy, morality, ethics into their development."}, {"speaker": "Nazanin Ijad", "time": "29:20", "text": "In an effort to maintain transparency with the public companies are increasingly publishing their policies with respect to AI. Both academia and industry require trust from the public to do the work that they do. This begs the question, since companies make a profit from human or patient data, should those who have given their information share in the profits as well. One of our audience members asked this exact question."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 2", "time": "29:44", "text": "Hi, there. Thank you for the session. My question is more about the ethics behind, a lot of the companies that are being developed right now through AI are based on patient data and can become quite profitable from that data. Do you think this is an ethical dilemma behind patients not having access to any of the profitability that amounts from their data that led to the algorithms or companies that are now existing?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "30:05", "text": "Should patients be remunerated? Should they participate in the wealth that's being generated from AI today? I think that's the question."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alison Paprica", "time": "30:15", "text": "I was on a panel at the Wellesley Institute with a woman from an organization who's focused on exactly that giving the people that contribute their data a share in the benefits that come back from it. That may be the way they go. There's, there's some literature about benefit sharing when it comes to data use generally. And it doesn't necessarily have to be that explicit. It could be an organization that builds a recreational facility or something. I think what we really need clarity around and they may be well intentioned, but these long privacy policies and Terms of Use, they're really not doing anything, you could read it and you wouldn't know, you know, does this company sell my data? Do I have the opportunity to opt out of them using my data? Really basic questions"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "30:54", "text": "So let me ask you a more pointed question. Then if I'm a company that's developing a platform that allows patients to control their and own their data, does that make it easier or difficult for innovation from a public health perspective or for AI research to be conducted?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Alison Paprica", "time": "31:09", "text": "I think at the end of the day, it will make it easier, but we'll have to acknowledge that you're not going to reach the whole population. I think we need transparency. It's just about how we get there."}, {"speaker": "Melissa Galati", "time": "31:19", "text": "The panel wrapped up with audience Q & A.

There are certainly there are fields in medicine that are dependent upon clinical activities that seem to appropriate themselves to AI, dermatology, radiology, where there's elements of pattern recognition, there are already inroads being made of machine learning into pathology and pathologic diagnostics. So those areas of medicine that really are pure pattern recognition, are probably if you think of kind of low lying fruit for AI to have a role, those are places. Does that negate the need for radiologists, dermatologists, pathologists? I'm not sure."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "32:18", "text": "So what's the new frontier that's opened up because we're seeing incredible advances in robotic surgery? So obviously, different skill sets. Are there areas that are opened up by AI, or robotic surgery, AI assisted robotic surgery?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Sunit Das", "time": "32:29", "text": "So, you know, we talked about I think this gets back to the question of, do we lose jobs because of AI. And you think about how much society has evolved in North America in the last 50 years because of changes in the need for industrialization. And those jobs haven't gone away, but they've evolved tremendously. And and I suspect we'd see the same."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 4", "time": "32:51", "text": "So ethics has a lot to do with intention, and even counterfactuals. Why? And if I did do this, even though I won't, what would happen? So what ways are you aware that people are addressing these things in, in medicine? What ways can we encode these in a model so AI that can answer why questions and can answer counterfactual questions? Thank you."}, {"speaker": "Chris Hammill", "time": "33:22", "text": "I'm happy to take this one. So lots of people are using causal inference these days, it's becoming very popular. Judea Pearl's \"Book of Why\" has become very popular recently. So as AI and machine learning get more and more popular, I think we're going to see more expert knowledge in the form of graph based models being used for decision making in medicine. And of course, we always need to be integrating over uncertainty when making counterfactual predictions, or even any type of estimation problem you'd be interested in."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Allan Miranda", "time": "33:51", "text": "Okay, we got time for one last question and I'm going to I'm going to use up that time and ask you guys if you're to look forward 10 years, from an artificial intelligence perspective, what will be different in your universe? What's the one thing that you think will be different?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Sunit Das", "time": "34:05", "text": "Much of what I do in neurosurgery actually doesn't involve neurosurgery per se. It's using tools like radiology to be able to make predictions of whether or not patients have good response to antepan therapies.

I think we're going to have channels that are going to be bringing us more data more quickly. And of course, the algorithmic research is progressing so quickly, things are changing every day. So it's hard to imagine how things are going to look in the in even 10 years time. I think things are moving at that kind of rate now.

But I'm really interested in ensuring that there's high quality data sets available for people to conduct AI, for the purposes of both transforming care and informing research."}, {"speaker": "Stephania Assimopoulos", "time": "5:18", "text": "We were really excited when putting together this panel because, as you'll find out soon, our panelists although all AI users have quite different perspectives, which made for a lively and engaging discussion, suffice to say that an agreement was not always reached."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "5:33", "text": "Before we dive in, what is the technical definition of artificial intelligence or AI? It's often a broad term used to encompass many methods and ideas. I definitely personally get lost trying to narrow it down. So how do our experts describe AI? Doctors Marzyeh Ghassemi and Jason Lerch gave a great definition to help clarify,"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi", "time": "5:51", "text": "Artificial intelligence is the colloquial term that's used to describe many methods that are used by statisticians, people who do optimization, people who do computer science. And we use these methods often to either do unsupervised learning; clustering, supervised learning; prediction, or causal/reinforcement learning, trying to understand cause and effect in data. So it's a large class of models, and it's a general term."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shreejoy Tripathy", "time": "6:25", "text": "Jason"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jason Lerch", "time": "6:27", "text": "It's hard to top that. It is statistics where you don't have to predefine your model exactly,"}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "6:32", "text": "Or equivalently, AI is a tool to find patterns in data with the help of machine learning, as Dr.s Kraus and Yu pointed out. Okay, now, let's dive in."}, {"speaker": "Stephania Assimopoulos", "time": "6:41", "text": "AI is often thought to be the holy grail of modern innovation, revolutionising technology, and leading to drastic progress. But that isn't necessarily the case, or is it just not the case yet? To understand the importance of AI, we wanted to know from our panelists how their respective fields work, prior to using AI, and how they are now starting off with Dr. Oren Kraus."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Oren Kraus", "time": "7:03", "text": "So yeah, the field of generating lots of microscopy data, it's called high content screening. And there's still a lot of data science that went into it just using the traditional computer vision techniques. So things like segmentation and feature extraction."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "7:17", "text": "What was it like before that?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Oren Kraus", "time": "7:19", "text": "It's really like..."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shreejoy Tripathy", "time": "7:20", "text": "dudes looking at photos?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Oren Kraus", "time": "7:22", "text": "Yeah, the scale came. And then, you know, once you had like, all these images, it was really like an afterthought of like, Okay, how do we analyze them. So in the big, the bigger companies were more focused on just kind of narrowing that down to a specific measurement. So something simple would be like cell viability, like are the cells alive or dead under this condition versus not. But the trend in the last 5 to 10 years has been thoroughly try to extract more and more information. And that's really where the content part of high content comes in. So measuring lots of parameters at once from every single cell and these large scale experiments. But what AI lets us do that really only took off in the last two to three years is really take a lot of the engineering that goes into that, because it would take weeks, months, or even years sometimes to analyze all these images. But now you can really apply the exact same techniques over and over again, and get results almost as fast as you can generate the experiment in the first place. So it really makes that whole tool set a lot more productive and a lot more useful."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "8:15", "text": "Can you give us a sense for just the amount of data you're talking? Are you talking like two slides or like 2 million?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Oren Kraus", "time": "8:20", "text": "Yeah, so the idea with these automated screens is you can image a whole like 384 or 1536-well plate within a matter of hours. And then the pharma companies will screen like, you know, 10s to hundreds of plates. So the data sets can be 300 gigabytes, to terabytes. And then, you know, you've generated that within a few days and want to analyze that almost as fast as you can generate it."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "8:41", "text": "Marzyeh if you wanna go next."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi", "time": "8:42", "text": "It's a hard question for me, because, you know, I was a computer scientist first. And so I think that the the big shift in medicine is that if you watch a doctor, at least in the ICU, and I spent a lot of time and ICUs during my PhD at MIT, so I rounded up at Israel with some of the attendings. Patient would come in, and I swear, they would look to me exactly the same as prior patients, and the doctors would, the senior doctors would call it. They would say, this one's not going to make it there, they're going to die. And I would say, okay, you know, I have my like, notepad Why? And they said, I'm not sure I have a sense I have these different words give shoulde sense, like, but they all essentially said the same thing. I just, I have a sense. And when you probe them on it, as annoying future academics do, right, they would finally come down to you know, I saw a patient once who had something like this, it was a while ago, but you know, it sort of looked this way. And so this makes sense to me in my in my head. And that makes a ton of sense. So you know, if you talk to the doctors, they'll tell you that they operate in a shocking lack of evidence right. You know, there is no compendium of every patient that's ever been seen and all the treatments that have been given to them. Nobody writes a textbook about that, if you're lucky, you'll get a case report about a bizarre patient, right. And people are trained reasonably consistently at very high profile academic hospitals. But you know, these teaching hospitals, they train you, and then you go off wherever you're going. And maybe you don't retrain, and maybe practice changes. Maybe you haven't seen a patient who looks like this very recently. And so I think that the the difference that machine learning can offer that AI and other tools can offer are, we can look at all the patients who have ever been seen in an institution, not just your institution, but everybody's institution. And we can see what kind of treatments actually work well for patients like the one you're seeing. And I think that that's amazing, because even the best doctors have to really think when they look at a patient, and then they can make that prediction. I think that we can make doctor's jobs more about providing care and less about guessing. And I think that that will improve care for everybody."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "11:07", "text": "Jason, Joanna, do you want to add to that?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jason Lerch", "time": "11:09", "text": "I think the main thing I would add is that in my part of neuroscience and brain imaging, and the more clinical side that I'm involved in, I don't think AI is had that big of an impact yet. So it's more coming. And I think the biggest association and where it's coming now is in ... AI is starting to replace what we can do with more classic image processing, and sometimes classic statistics. But it can yet or has not yet helped in improving understanding. And I think that's one of the big things that probably have more of a discussion of today, in terms of to what extent can you have a large data set and learn what we already know, and apply it much more efficiently and potentially more robustly? And to what extent are you trying to get something new out of it?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shreejoy Tripathy", "time": "11:53", "text": "Can you ... I'm just gonna push back on that. So can you give, quickly give an example of what you would mean by understanding?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jason Lerch", "time": "11:59", "text": "So what I mean is, what very often happens with AI algorithms is that you can provide a large training data set. And you can say, can you discriminate, and to use the example we just heard cases that will make it in cases that will not? And then it'll tell you, I can do this with 88% accuracy or whatever the numbers might be. And then starts, what's almost a process of archaeology of figuring out well, what is it about these patients? Which can often be very difficult to learn from especially more complicated, deeper neural net, or whatever it is that you've used to apply this tool, compared to the more classic way of analyzing the data where if you use multivariate statistics for massive univariate statistics, where the accuracy wouldn't be anywhere close to that high, but our ability to interpret what the models are telling us is still higher."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "12:43", "text": "Right. So there's the ... Challenge is, you know, these tools seem to work, but no one really, maybe you don't know why or how they work."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jason Lerch", "time": "12:51", "text": "Right. And there's a lot of really interesting work happening in that field of trying to understand and interpret the output of what did the learning algorithm learn? But it isn't always immediately clear. Why is this actually working?"}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "13:02", "text": "Yeah. Joanna, can you speak a bit to so the brain health data bank account is still being built? But can you speak a bit to maybe some of the promise of or maybe what, what is going to go in it? And then how we're hoping that? Oh, yeah,"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Joanna Yu", "time": "13:14", "text": "Definitely. So I think, I think the further to Marzyeh's points about, you know, being able to compare to similar population, then predicting whether or not the patient will will receive a positive or negative outcome, in order to be able to do that, we really need to be able to have this data centralized, standardized of high quality, and I think that some of the largest amount of challenges going across, she's nodding, she moves across hospital, even within a hospital. And so part of what the brain health database is doing is really looking to ... that are integrate clinical and research data and also improve the quality of it, you know, can we have standardized assessments being used across clinics as appropriate, can we then layer on additional research measures, including blood  samples, or even wearables, so that we don't just have data from when the patients come into the clinic, but in their, in the real world, in their in their lives? And just to add to that, you know, I think where we're going is like, not only when they come in when there's something wrong with them, but even after the discharge can we continue to follow them to, to be able to really apply all these AI and machine learning algorithms to the full capacity except that they're able to, to hold promise for improving our future."}, {"speaker": "Stephania Assimopoulos", "time": "14:19", "text": "So from what we just heard, AI has made an impact in some fields and contexts more than others, but also in different ways. AI is leading towards more personalized medical decisions based on evidence from big data sets. However, we need to rethink how to most effectively collect such big data sets, both in the short and long term for each patient. It's also important to look past the hype and think of what we have actually gained in terms of understanding while keeping in mind the challenges related to AI."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "14:44", "text": "So the question is like, what are some challenges that you face using AI in your work? Joanna, what... maybe we can start with you and I want to know, is there pushback from like the clinicians that CAMH in these you know, old school, old school doctors who are like, why do I need to like you know, use this measure? Or some other measure? And does this data really need to go into a database? And can we can we just do things the old way?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Joanna Yu", "time": "15:05", "text": "Yeah, so that's a great question. I mean, we're fortunate at CAMH to have worked with a lot of, we're working with a lot of programs that have already developed standardized care pathways. So in that sense, there's buy in from the clinicians and the clinic and integrated care teams to be at nurses and therapists as well to be following some sort of standard data collection process. But I think they're, you know, what's really neat about this process, that we're building it together, so a lot of it, it's co design, imagine, you know, we someone discovered this fancy AI algorithm, 90% prediction rate, we can tell who's gonna respond to drug A, positively, and we just sort of walked into the clinic told the psychiatrist, listen, we've got this. I mean, they've also had a ton of training a ton of background, they also understand that there's different circumstances for each patient that makes each case unique. And there's a need for personalized medicine as well. But I think we're not in an era where AI is to replace the doctor, the physicians, but at the same time, can we co design to expedite how we develop these algorithms, because there's certain expertise that is not captured by just the data themselves are certain inherent knowledge that is within the experts, psychiatrists, therapists, everyone that can also contribute and expedite how we how we move forward."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "16:14", "text": "That's cool. Oren, can you speak a bit to some of the challenges and implementing AI in your work? And maybe you speak a bit to, you know, using AI in a company?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Oren Kraus", "time": "16:23", "text": "Sure. Yeah, there's definite challenges on the infrastructure side. So you know, it's okay if you're a data scientist working on a specific data set, and you can get results relatively quickly. But once you want to build something that works reproducibly across like lots of different experiments, or whatever the data sources, you really need to put a lot of effort into the engineering and, you know, getting different types of skills together, in order to get that whole thing working. In terms of the AI component, you know, the idea of training supervised models where you know, conditions ahead of time that you care to classify, that tends to work relatively straightforwardly for what the field is interested in. And like, I think, in general, across all of drug discovery, or life sciences, actually discovering new biology or just new relations in general and the data sets that we're generating. And in that setting, it's a bit harder to apply AI. Because, you know, if you use some of these unsupervised clustering techniques, it's really hard to know whether you're finding something of interest or just experimental noise. So that's something we're actively exploring at Phenomic AI, and other researchers too, is how to design algorithms that really kind of let the biologists or their scientists interact with the with the results and also give feedback and kind of close that loop between the data science and the experiment."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jason Lerch", "time": "17:34", "text": "I guess the two ... and one have spoken to already a little bit, which is the separation between performance and understanding of gaining understanding from the algorithms. And the other big one. So far, still, the simply numbers ... is to train an algorithm, you very often need large number of samples being put in or large data sets."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "17:54", "text": "Yeah, and you get a sense for, you know, for your field, what numbers we're talking about here."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jason Lerch", "time": "18:00", "text": "It really depends on the application. So I've seen two types of applications. One of them is where AI replaces image processing. And they're very often you can bootstrap your way to the right number of samples. So you might take a data set of 10,000 brains, you segmented using classic tools, you use that to train an AI algorithm that then does a better, more robust or much quicker job of segmenting the same brain. So I think they're less worried about it. But he's starting to talk about predicting patient response trying to find who is going to provide respond to what drug, and we tend to work in the world of rare disorders. There are seven patients in the world of that particular disorder, that's a very hard algorithm to train. Or I mean, seven is the except... is the extreme, but very often, it gets into the 10s, 20s, few hundreds with all sorts of heterogeneity and diversity in there. So if it's on the patient prediction type outcome, that's much more of a challenge when you're in the rare disorders world than it is in some of the more common fields and trying to understand how do you begin to generalize from one set of patient groups to another? And how do you begin to not... to train these algorithms when you don't have the classic training data set available? "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shreejoy Tripathy", "time": "19:04", "text": "Right, yeah. Marzyeh, do you have more comments about challenges?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi", "time": "19:07", "text": "No, I think it's ..., I don't think it's that challenging to use. So maybe, no, not particularly, no."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "19:13", "text": "No? So. So AI will solve everything?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi", "time": "19:16", "text": "I mean, people use calculators. There are already risk scores in the ICU, you come in, they like add up seven numbers. And they're like, Yeah, that one has this score, right? Like, it's a fancier calculator, if you want to use it that way, right? Like there's a convolutional neural network is just not requiring you to specify the features that you want. Like in the pre conv-net days, you had to say, I think something is happening at frequency 75 hertz. And no, seriously, you would talk to a cardiologist and they would say, like, look at this component of the QRS. And, you know, if you can just learn that from a convolutional neural network and get an equivalent categorization. I think it's fantastic. I think if we're talking about exploring new science, right? All techniques should be, you know, put under extreme scrutiny, right? If we're trying to predict new drug responses or something completely novel where we are doing completely new science, then it doesn't matter that that technique is AI, you should be terrified if your logistic regression model is super confident to., right? like, and I also had... this is this is a recent burn I had on a paper review, Somebody said, Well, you know, you should use a logistic regression model, because it's interpretable. And I want to know who thinks in log odds in this room? Who thinks in like e to the beta knot plus beta one x one plus ... nobody, nobody. I agree that low capacity models are often easier to look at, because we have ways that we have trained ourselves to look at them. But there are ways to look at high capacity models. So I don't think it'll solve everything. But I also think it's a tool just like all other methods we use. "}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "20:58", "text": "It was interesting to hear Dr. Ghassemi's comment about AI just being another tool if a more complex one. This helped put AI in context with other multivariate approaches that currently exist and present their own challenges."}, {"speaker": "Stephania Assimopoulos", "time": "21:09", "text": "This was supplemented by Dr Lerch's compelling comments on the generalizability of these tools based on the task at hand. Unlike a calculator, it is variable. It's a more complicated tool than others we have used so far. And there are some key requirements to make it work for us like having good data. Although often presented as such, it's not a magical black box that would always do what we wanted to reliably. There are standards and difficulties associated with each case, and caution is required."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "21:36", "text": "However, all panelists converged on the complex challenges related to assessing if models are generalizable. And the importance of closing the feedback loop to integrate clinicians and biologists into model development and validation. "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shreejoy Tripathy", "time": "21:49", "text": "We've spoken to this point a little bit, but can we hear a bit more about what's the role of human experts, or like, basically doctors as ... so these algorithms are coming online as they're improving? Like, do they still have a role? And if so, what is the role like ... Marzyeh, if you want to start? "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi", "time": "22:03", "text": "Yeah, I think the machine learning for health community, at least the the people, you know, I know who worked primarily in EHR, in hospitals on longitudinal health records, nobody would ever claim that we're trying to replace the doctor, because that's not anybody's goal. A lot of what we're trying to do is provide better recommendations or better evidence or better options. But just like in most fields that automation has touched in some way, you always need a pilot, right? You always want somebody at the end of the line, who makes a decision about something. And I think the the sort of wrinkle for healthcare is think about other fields like like flying, right? You know, altitude is an absolute value, like, I know what altitude I'm at, right? You know, the plane, it crashes, or it does not crash, right? You can measure how much bouncing it does. So you can say how good a job your model did at landing the plane. So medicine, healthcare in general, is a setting where experts make decisions about what is the diagnosis, they can decide something is a syndrome one day they can combine it with something else another day. Decisions about diagnosis and phenotype are made by doctors, right? There are many conditions that used to be considered one thing, but now are multiple things, right? Because we've learned over time that they should be separated, science has made an adjustment. And so I think that while you know, experts get to decide what a what a condition is, experts are allowed to disagree. Which is ... which is very unique, honestly, in many of the fields that automation has, has transformed. Usually, if we say that's a chair, it's a chair, and every expert in this room will say it's a chair, right? But that's not true in medicine, if you ask if somebody is diabetic, and when they were diabetic people disagree about the onset time. And then even if you could have a complete compendium of these are all the reasons I might have an onset time. Do you have the data to establish that?"}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "24:10", "text": "Yeah, that's really interesting. Maybe real quick, can someone sort of answer the question? Like, do we think we hold AI to a higher bar in medicine than we would for other ... Like in other fields?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Oren Kraus", "time": "24:21", "text": "Yeah, I'm not from the medicine space. But I think so. Yeah, you can also compare it to, like autonomous driving ... "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shreejoy Tripathy", "time": "24:26", "text": "Yeah, right. Uber is, you know, killing people."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Oren Kraus", "time": "24:28", "text": "Yeah. So that's right. You know, like, even though, overall, even today, we probably be safer with ... if everyone had an autonomous vehicle, you know, we're still terrified of, you know, at least like one of them making a mistake, like, you know, once a year or something. And medicine, I think, like, yeah, like Marzyeh said, there's, it's not like we're gonna be replacing doctors, and they're still gonna have the final decision. So I think it's a matter of more of like educating doctors about how to use new tools. So that could be more of a generational thing. It might take, like the next generation of doctors to really adopt some of these newer technologies."}, {"speaker": "Grace Jacobs", "time": "24:58", "text": "And pause! Before we move on to our next question, we want to line things up by asking our panelists to address some common misconceptions about AI in the Lightning Round."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "25:06", "text": "Okay, so I have five questions that I've asked you guys, and you're gonna get a placard that says, agree or disagree. So I'm gonna say, I'm gonna say a statement, and then you're going to agree and disagree. I'm going to quickly tally up the things and maybe ask one of you to say a quick comment about it before we move on to the next question. Okay, so the first question, AI can be more accurate than the decisions of human experts. For a freeze! We don't have our doctor on the panel drop out. I wonder what she would say. Okay, question number two, AI works in the same way that a human brain does. Oh, Oren why do you say agree?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Oren Kraus", "time": "25:46", "text": "Yeah, I think we learned from experience, we just experienced things a lot slower than that a computer would, right. So like, part of the reason that, for example, algorithms that are trained on a lot of data to make diagnosis are better just because they see tons of examples from tons of different doctors, whereas in your own life, you see, you know, however many patients you can see a day and you make those decisions, or in med school, you learn from, you know, case studies or textbooks. So, the amount of experience you have is very, very limited compared to what you can feed on algorithm."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "26:13", "text": "Right. So, in the sense they both learned, but Jason really quick, why do you think they do this? Why do you say disagree for AI does not work how the human brain works?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jason Lerch", "time": "26:19", "text": "Doesn't AI algorithm have to sleep to consolidate memories?"}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "26:25", "text": "Marzyeh, I don't think so. Right? Well, the thing with like, those cool algorithms, like what would that fit the algorithms that like sort of destroy chess is like, they can just run all day and all night, and then they destroy our best chess players. Question number three, AI is free of bias. Four solid disagrees. Cool. Moving on. AI that is good as one thing ... good at one thing will be good at other things. Four disagrees. Okay. And then one sort of controversial question. The use of AI in medicine has already led to the incorrect ... incorrect treatment of someone and their ... and their death. Okay, three agrees. And one disagree. We have a couple of maybes. But does someone want to speak more? Marzyeh do you want to speak to agree?"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi", "time": "27:12", "text": "It depends on what you call AI. But if we're saying that, you know, risk calculators, right, our AI, right that like simple logistic regression models or random forests, the issue is, you know, humans deploy these things, right. And so I know, they ... a hospital where they made a risk score that did not include race. And the hospital administrator said that they noticed that they were actually having more ... more deaths in black patients who came in with pneumonia than white patients, because the the risk score was miscalibrated. And not because of any physiological thing. But because in this particular urban setting, I'm trying really hard not to disclose anything, there was a substantial low income black population. And so the assumption by some of the attendings who I knew personally was, if they came in and they had a fever, and they were shaking, they were withdrawing, they were on something and so they didn't do the prophylactic administrative ... administration of the antibiotic, because the risk score, you know, didn't take into account that there there are social determinants of health, right, that often overpower your age, your height, your glucose level, your heart rate,"}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "28:37", "text": "That's a great example of bias and how you say, Well, yeah, that's something to keep in mind, you know, as, as AI proselytizers, in a sense, you know,"}, {"speaker": "Dr. Marzyeh Ghassemi", "time": "28:47", "text": "And I think it's important when a local hospital approaches me, I want to be really sure about how rigorously we can check our results in many ways."}, {"speaker": "Audience Member 3", "time": "28:57", "text": "Okay, so let's we're done with the lightning round, you can put your placards down.

So we might have to look in the mirror to see whose fault this is as well. "}, {"speaker": "Dr. Shreejoy Tripathy", "time": "29:46", "text": "Right? Yeah. How can we better inform the public at some about some of the realities of AI especially given that like, you know, it's still you know, this it's still nascent, right. Marzyeh's work is a great example but it definitely not perfect, right. And like self driving cars, you know, like they're driving on the road, and they're driving for hours, but they're still killing people. So what do we do in this like transition time to help manage the help manage the hype in the public."}, {"speaker": "Dr. Jason Lerch", "time": "30:10", "text": "I'm not sure if it's different for AI than it's for anything and out of medicine or engineering that's coming out, there's often something comes out, everybody's very excited. And then over the years, it begins to settle more into here's what it can, here's what it can't do. And AI comes down to especially this idea that no matter how perfect the algorithm, if you feed in garbage to train it, you're going to get garbage out.

So that's something we can't really do yet with, with a lot of the machine learning techniques. So kind of communicating, like those limitations.

And so the state of California decided to do this, right, reduce classroom sizes, and it failed miserably. The students didn't do better. And it's because they have a larger number of students that they have to educate. And so smaller classroom sizes meant teachers were going room to room there weren't ... they had to cover multiple locations, you were splitting up groups of kids who maybe ... were in teams together previously. And so one of the things that Dr. Kleinberg said yesterday in her talk is knowing the causal effect is not good enough, knowing the 80% positive or predictive value isn't. Knowing the necessary and sufficient conditions to reproduce that causal effect are. And I think that's what our limitations sections usually say.

That's very normal in most medical care, right. A lot of medical practice has these checklists, or these risk scores, that doctors are hand adding on sheets of paper.

And so if you d identify HIPAA, there's under HIPAA standards, there's 23 fields that are PHI, you get certified that you de-identified them to this standard. You were then allowed to release that data to researchers like me, so that I can run whatever model I want on my own GPUs, and is HIPAA compliant, because I have done the appropriate training in the United States, there's CITI training. Here it is CPTP training that has it's very similar. This is the equivalent you should have in your head to map to and I signed an End User License Agreement saying I would never try to re identify this and I would never try to redistribute this. And then me and my whole lab are able to use this data and this is fantastic. The US is definitely moving in this direction, right where they say, well de-identify things, and then we'll say that researchers should be able to use this in their work. I don't think that Canada is quite there in terms of social acceptance. And I'm a newcomer here. And so I don't know how quickly that's going to change.

And on the research side is, I think she covered all the points really there. We also have key HIPAA as well, you ... you are required to de identify it. And different models are used in different places. So for example, when you're in a research study, if you additionally want to gain access to data that was collected for clinical purposes, the research ethics board would have to give their approval and you would also have to obtain consent from the patient. So going forward, the question becomes, in our ... in our healthcare system in hospitals, do we want to empower patients inform patients that we are using their data for additional research questions beyond just providing them clinical care.

Dr. Ruth Ross is a professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Toronto. She talks about how THC interacts with the endocannabinoid system at the molecular level, and the potential to target this complex system for therapeutic purposes. Karolina Kozak is a PhD candidate from Dr. Tony George's lab at CAMH. Her work focuses on cannabis use disorder in schizophrenia and she tells us about what exactly happens with the brain in addiction. We also delve into some of the societal impacts of cannabis legalization in this episode. We talked to Dr. Pat Erickson, a professor emerita at the Department of Sociology at the University of Toronto. Her work looked at some of the personal and societal impacts of criminalization.
