However, antibiotic resistance can occur when the bacteria being targeted change in response and render the antibiotic ineffective. Antibiotic resistance is a global threat and there are concerns that by the year 2050, antibiotic resistant infections could cause more than 10 million deaths annually. In this episode, we explore the drivers of antibiotic resistance around the world and speak to researchers tackling this issue through their research on innovative therapies and solutions.

Imagine not getting any matches on a dating profile because 2 years ago you got into a car accident and now you get from place to place in a wheelchair. Imagine what it feels like to have your body be looked at as a problem to be solved. In this episode, we are trying to address ableism by talking to people with lived experience about what having a disability means to them while living in our society and culture today. We talk to disability advocates about the important work they are doing to help challenge how we define disability. Is disability a design problem that we can solve? We also touch on topics that many of us think about on a daily basis: sex, dating. We hope that this episode will help you reflect on some biases you have about living with a disability and think about what you can do to make your world more accessible, because we all deserve the same opportunities in life regardless of our physical ability.", "authors": ["Claire Mazzia"], "prod_team": {"cc": ["Claire Mazzia"], "sh": ["Seth Kibel", "James Saravanamuttu", "Aditi Desai"], "ep": ["Yagnesh Ladumor"], "ae": ["Anukrati Nigam"], "pv": ["Mehran Karimzadeh"], "sm": ["Eman Nishat"]}, "tags": [], "links": [{"title": "The Disabled List", "href": "https://www.disabledlist.org"}, {"title": "Dr. Jeff Preston's website", "href": "http://www.jeffpreston.ca"}, {"title": "Centre for Independent Living in Toronto", "href": "https://www.cilt.ca"}]}, {"no": 84, "title": "Passports and Procedures: Receiving and Providing Care Abroad", "blubrry": "69858254", "date": "November 4, 2020", "season": 5, "img_tile": "adele-kulyk.jpg", "img_caption": "Dr. Noelle Sullivan and her colleague, Chris Mmbwambo in Tanzania, who runs the NGO TEKUA.

Adele explains what may drive people to leave and what sort of procedures are accessed abroad.

To understand this theme, we sat down with Dr. Noelle Sullivan, a professor in anthropology at Northwestern University, and Dr. Jessica Evert, Family Medicine Physician at UCSF.

Aristotle shared with us his amputation journey, from the difficult decision to have the surgery, to his ongoing work building and supporting the amputee community here in the GTA. Next, Dr. Amanda Mayo, a physiatrist with St. John's Rehab at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, explained the common reasons for amputation and considerations for surgical planning. Dr. Mayo also described the funding challenges experienced by amputees in Canada seeking to make the most of modern prosthetic technologies.

Yet, memory is not without its faults. In this episode of Raw Talk Podcast, we try to understand what memory is, the processes that affect the quality of our memories and the implications of faulty memory on the validity of eyewitness testimonies in the legal system. First we hear from Joey DeGrandis who shares his unique ability to recall specific details of autobiographical events. This rare memory phenomenon, known as Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (HSAM), provides an opportunity to investigate the brain systems underlying enhanced memory and conversely memory loss.  We then hear from Dr. Amy Finn, an assistant professor at the Department of  Psychology at the University of Toronto, and the principal investigator of the Learning and Neural Development Lab. Dr. Finn discusses memory formation and how the brain and cognitive development constrains and enables learning, using examples, such as the famous case of patient H.M. To better understand the 'faults in our memory', Dr. Daniel Schacter, a Harvard University Professor, discusses his work on how memory's malfunctions may be classified into seven fundamental transgressions or \"sins\" and describes the seven sins of memory errors. Finally, we hear from Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, who shares her experience on how memory may be manipulated and modified by messages, ideas, suggestions and other post-event information.

First, we spoke with Dr. Kamran Khan, a physician, academic, and scientist at St. Micheal's Hospital and University of Toronto. Dr. Khan is an Associate Professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and the Institute of Health Policy Management and Evaluation at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health. He also founded BlueDot, a company specializing in machine learning models to predict the timing and trajectory of infectious disease outbreaks. We also spoke with Dr. Ross Upshur, a professor at the University of Toronto in the Department of Family and Community Medicine. Dr. Upshur is a specialist in public health medicine, and Head of the Clinical Public Health Division at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health.

First, we heard from George Kourounis, renowned global adventurer, storm chaser, and host of Angry Planet, who clarified the difference between climate and weather, and described the impacts of climate change we're already feeling. Next, we listened in on a talk by Gideon Forman, a Policy Analyst at the David Suzuki Foundation and former Executive Director of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE). He discussed the magnitude of climate change in the context of health. Dr. Chung-Wai Chow, a lung transplant physician and leading research scientist at the University Health Network, whom we heard from in episode 38, elaborated on the effects of wildfires and pollution on respiratory health, based on her research in Fort McMurray. You'll also hear from Dr. Edward Xie and learn more about how other vulnerable populations are being impacted by climate change, from Indigenous communities in Canada to climate refugees across the globe. Dr Xie helped us understand how increased flooding, droughts, and spread of infectious diseases are further stressing fragile health systems based on his work as an emergency and family physician at the University of Toronto and board member of CAPE.

This is especially true for several psychiatric conditions, where finding the right medication for someone has relied heavily on trial and error. In this episode, we talked to Dr. James Kennedy and Dr. Daniel Mueller, clinician scientists at CAMH and co-principal investigators of the IMPACT study, which aims to personalize the treatment of several psychiatric conditions.

We sat down with some researchers who study cannabis at the University of Toronto to learn about the science behind cannabis. The conversation starts with Lauren DeFreitas, a graduate student at CAMH whose research focuses on the THC and CBD content of different products and how these active chemical compounds in cannabis impact health outcomes. Dr. Ruth Ross is a professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Toronto. She talks about how THC interacts with the endocannabinoid system at the molecular level, and the potential to target this complex system for therapeutic purposes. Karolina Kozak is a PhD candidate from Dr. Tony George's lab at CAMH. Her work focuses on cannabis use disorder in schizophrenia and she tells us about what exactly happens with the brain in addiction. We also delve into some of the societal impacts of cannabis legalization in this episode. We talked to Dr. Pat Erickson, a professor emerita at the Department of Sociology at the University of Toronto. Her work looked at some of the personal and societal impacts of criminalization. We'll hear from her about the normalization of cannabis use over time, and the importance of having engaging and accurate educational material, especially for youth, now that it has been legalized. Sudha Sabanadesan is a policy development officer at Toronto Public Health. She tells us about some of the concerns they have going forward, including cannabis use by adolescents and driving while impaired, and the public health perspective on harm reduction.
