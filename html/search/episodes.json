  "notes": "Homelessness remains a persistent, societal and human rights issue that affects over 250,000 Canadians. The challenges go beyond just finding a place to live \u2013 those who are homeless or vulnerably housed have higher incidences of chronic mental and physical health problems and often face stigma while navigating the healthcare system. On this episode, we heard from different voices at the intersection of homelessness and health. We started our conversation with Linda Bingham from Working for Change, who shared her lived experience with homelessness and addiction and how she has now found her voice to tell her story for the very first time. We also spoke to Daniela Mergarten, who told us about her struggles to find stable housing, her experiences with the healthcare system, and her advocacy work with the Lived Experience Caucus of the Toronto Alliance to End Homelessness. Dr. Alissa Tedesco, a physician in the Palliative Education and Care for the Homeless (PEACH) program and co-chair of Health Providers Against Poverty (HPAP) Ontario, told us about the work being done on the frontline to address the healthcare needs of people who are homeless as well as some of the shortcomings of our healthcare and social service systems. Finally, Dr. Vicky Stergiopoulos, a clinician-scientist and physician in chief at CAMH, told us about her work looking at the effectiveness of a Housing First approach to improve housing stability and health outcomes amongst people experiencing homelessness.",

  "notes": "Humans have been captivated by the power of psychedelics for millennia. Traditionally, natural psychedelics have been used in religious rituals to communicate with gods or in warfare to take courage. More casual use of synthetic psychedelics like LSD and DMT is often depicted in movies and songs as surreal and stimulating events. Despite being highly regulated and poorly studied, people continue to use psychedelics for the unique and impactful experiences. In today\u2019s episode, we want to learn what science says about these magic drugs. Dr. Edward Shorter, Professor of History of Medicine and an author of many books on medical drugs, talked to us about how psychedelics were discovered. We also spoke to scientists who explore the potential therapeutic use of psychedelics. Dr. Fred Barrett, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences at Johns Hopkins University, gave us an overview of current understanding of psychedelics on brain function. Dr. Norm Farb, Professor of Psychology at University of Toronto Mississauga, explained to us his upcoming trial on psychedelic microdosing. Finally, one of our hosts Amber Mullin shared with us her personal experiences with and perspectives on psychedelics. Tune in to find out what psychedelics have to offer.",

Space exploration is exciting, but we are far from understanding all the effects of space travel on the human body. In today's episode, we spoke to Dr. Shane Journeay, a physician specializing in physical and rehabilitation medicine. He told us about the requirements for becoming an astronaut, the physical toll of space travel, and the rehabilitation required after returning to Earth. We also spoke to former CSA astronaut and physician Dr. Dave Williams, who told us all about his experience on the International Space Station - from eating and sleeping to running experiments in outer space. Scientists Dr. Laurence Harris and Marieke de Korte told us about the space health research they're involved with, and Pierre-Alexandre Fournier, CEO of Hexoskin, told us about Astroskin, an intelligent textile that continuously monitors the vital signs of astronauts.

In this week's episode, we turned to leading Canadian science advocates for advice on how we can speak up for science. Dr. David Naylor, former President of the University of Toronto and chair of the recent Fundamental Science Review (throwback to episode 65), spoke to us about the importance of fostering a science culture and the misuse of science by politicians. Dr. Molly Shoichet, University Professor at U of T and former Ontario Chief Scientist, shared with us her views on the politicization of science, the vitality of science evidence in providing policy solutions for the future, and the inclusion of scientists into the decision-making process. You'll also hear from Dr. Imogen Coe, Founding Dean of Science and Professor at Ryerson University, as well as a champion for equity, diversity and, inclusion programs in Canada. She further illustrated the importance of active science communication to improve contributions to science. We spoke to Farah Qaiser, President of the science advocacy organization Toronto Science Policy Network and Graduate Student at U of T, who provided us with a student's perspective on these vital issues in addition to discussing the ongoing Vote Science campaign - a great and easy way for everyone and anyone to get involved in the world of science policy. Last, but certainly not least, Dr. Amanda Veri, a Research associate at U of T shared her inspiring example of science advocacy we hope will light a fire in you as we approach election day.",

But what happens when your relationship with food impacts your life negatively? On this week's episode, we aimed to gain a greater perspective on Eating Disorders with the help of several guests. Tracie Burke and Holly Dickinson are two Registered Dietitians working with the Eating Disorders Program at Toronto General Hospital, who guide us through the steps their patients take in the program. You'll also hear from Candice Richardson who shares her lived experience with eating disorders. Candice and her colleague Ary Maharaj also work with the National Eating Disorder Information Centre (NEDIC), conducting outreach and providing support to and information for patients and their families. Finally, we dive into the latest research on eating disorders with Dr. Allan Kaplan, Senior Scientist and Psychiatrist at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health who investigates the psychobiological factors of Eating Disorders and Shauna Solomon-Krakus, a PhD Candidate whose thesis focuses on the relationship between personality, emotions, and eating disorders.

Currently, our generation has access to more information than at any other time in human history. But what are we doing to stay critical of all the information we receive? How do we separate the fact from the fiction? On today's episode, our team explores the state of science literacy, current initiatives aimed at improving science literacy, and how medical practice has changed in this \"information\" era. Melissa and Anton took it to the streets of Toronto to get a sense of where the general public gets their science information and how they decide whether to believe what they hear. Next, Richie spoke with Dr. Vince Stendardo, a family doctor in Toronto, about how the abundance of information available to patients online has changed his practice. Melissa also spoke with Jesse Hildebrand, a University of Toronto alum and founder of Science Literacy Week, to discuss his work with science promotion and outreach. Lastly, Amber sat down with Dr. Roger Riendeau, professor in the writing and rhetoric program at the University of Toronto, to talk about the illusions and reality of evidence, and how people process evidence in order to reach conclusions. So before you fall prey to the next big \"fake news\" story, tune in to find out how you can be more science literate. Until next time, keep it raw!",

These events are oftentimes sensationalized, drawing attention to the nature of the crime, and blurring the circumstances and neurobiology that played a role in setting the stage. Today's episode explores the intersection of violence and mental illness, and among other things, talks about how crime in this context could be interpreted as a symptom of inadequate care. To start, we sat down with Dr. Hy Bloom, a forensic psychiatrist and lawyer, and part-time staff member in the Complex Mental Illness/Forensic Services Program at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH). With one foot in the medical world, and another in the legal realm, he talked about the legal nuances of forensic psychiatry. Next was Dr. Sandy Simpson, a clinician-scientist and the Chief of Forensic Psychiatry at CAMH. Dr. Simpson talked about his international research in the field, and emphasized the need for more community-based services. Finally, Dr. James Cantor, a clinical psychologist and Director of the Toronto Sexuality Centre, spoke to us about his practice and research in the field of pedophilia and paraphilias. Tune in for an episode as riveting as any true crime story you have listened to. Until next time, keep it raw!",

  "notes": "Have you ever had a bad reaction to a medication? Or realized that it just wasn't helping at all? The way someone responds to a particular drug -  how effective it is and whether they experience any side effects -  can vary greatly between individuals, and it's becoming apparent that a personalized approach is needed when treating many conditions. This is especially true for several psychiatric conditions, where finding the right medication for someone has relied heavily on trial and error. In this episode, we talked to Dr. James Kennedy and Dr. Daniel Mueller, clinician scientists at CAMH and co-principal investigators of the IMPACT study, which aims to personalize the treatment of several psychiatric conditions. Catherine Virelli, a student in the Translational Research Program working with Dr. Kennedy, told us about the steps and challenges involved with bringing predictive tools produced by programs like IMPACT into clinical use. We also sat down with Dr. Christine Bear, senior scientist at Sick Kids and director of CFIT - the Program for Individualized Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Therapy. She told us about why an individualized approach is necessary for treating CF and how the CFIT program can be useful for discovering new personalized therapies for patients.",

  "notes": "Aging is a biological process that acts on all of us, from the day we're born until the day we die. And for many people, it is a cause for concern. In fact, some scientists believe aging should be classified as a disease. Memory loss, aches and pains, wrinkles, loneliness - there are a lot of reasons for why one might fear getting old. On this episode of Raw Talk, we talk to memory expert Dr. Morris Moscovitch to unpack how and why our memory suffers as we age and discuss the ways in which memory loss can be delayed. Richie explains some of the molecular mechanisms surrounding aging. Finally, we spoke with Dr. Esme Fuller-Thomson, who shares why we may not need to be as worried about our aging population as we thought. She also voices her thoughts on creative considerations to improve healthcare for older adults as well as how to make our cities more age-friendly. Written by: Melissa Galati",

Today, we use the term autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to describe developmental conditions that affect the communication and behaviour of individuals, with a wide range of symptoms and severities. Clearly, ASD is a complex condition and our understanding of it is constantly evolving. In this episode, you'll hear from two clinician-scientists at CAMH, Dr. Meng-Chuan Lai and Dr. Stephanie Ameis, who cover all the basics on ASD, and some newer research topics like sex and gender differences in autism. Dr. Stephen Scherer, a senior scientist at The Hospital for Sick Children, told us about his work on MSSNG, an exciting collaboration with Google and Autism Speaks, to uncover the genetic basis of ASD. You'll also hear from Connie Putterman, telling the story of her son's ASD diagnosis and how she came to be an advocate for autism research, as well as Rouya Botlani, who shares what she's learned through her work with students who have autism, at U of T Accessibility Services.",

Today's episode questions where this and other daily hygiene/cleanliness routines come from, and explores the unique intersection at which dermatology lies -  between medicine, and beauty. We talked to two dermatologists, medical professionals that specialize in the domain of skin, hair and nails for this purpose. Dr. Sandy Skotnicki, Founder of the Bay Dermatology Centre and Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, told us about her new book Beyond Soap, exploring our culture's hygiene practices, and enlightening us on the sinister side of soap. Dr. Julia Carroll, Ontario Regional Director of the Canadian Dermatology Association, discussed the complex interplay between dermatological conditions and cosmetics, and how these things are hard to untangle. To wrap up, we asked the question we know you are perhaps most interested in: what are the most essential products for healthy and well-balanced skin? Tune in to find out!

We spoke with Lee Maracle, Traditional Teacher at First Nations House about Indigenous perspectives on health. Next, Julie Bull, Research Methods Specialist at the Centre for Addictions and Mental Health, Dr. Michael Anderson, physician and researcher at the Waakebiness-Bryce Institute for Indigenous Health, and Dr. Raglan Maddox, post-doctoral fellow and researcher at the Well Living House, all shared their experiences in conducting research in partnership with Indigenous communities. Finally, Drs. Lisa Richardson and Jason Pennington talk about their efforts as curricular co-leads of Indigenous Health Education in the Faculty of Medicine to improve Indigenous health education for the next generation of clinicians. We hope this episode prompts you to appreciate the multitude of ways of knowing the world and inspires you to disrupt cultures that do not allow for these ways to co-exist.

Just about everybody has an opinion on cannabis legalization. Throughout this episode, you'll hear from people around downtown Toronto, sharing their views on legalization and some interesting personal experiences. There are also many misconceptions out there. We sat down with some researchers who study cannabis at the University of Toronto to learn about the science behind cannabis. The conversation starts with Lauren DeFreitas, a graduate student at CAMH whose research focuses on the THC and CBD content of different products and how these active chemical compounds in cannabis impact health outcomes. Dr. Ruth Ross is a professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology at the University of Toronto. She talks about how THC interacts with the endocannabinoid system at the molecular level, and the potential to target this complex system for therapeutic purposes. Karolina Kozak is a PhD candidate from Dr. Tony George's lab at CAMH. Her work focuses on cannabis use disorder in schizophrenia and she tells us about what exactly happens with the brain in addiction. We also delve into some of the societal impacts of cannabis legalization in this episode. We talked to Dr. Pat Erickson, a professor emerita at the Department of Sociology at the University of Toronto. Her work looked at some of the personal and societal impacts of criminalization. We'll hear from her about the normalization of cannabis use over time, and the importance of having engaging and accurate educational material, especially for youth, now that it has been legalized. Sudha Sabanadesan is a policy development officer at Toronto Public Health. She tells us about some of the concerns they have going forward, including cannabis use by adolescents and driving while impaired, and the public health perspective on harm reduction.

Now imagine if your lungs failed to function properly, what would happen to your quality of life? How long would you be able to live? What therapies are available to you? These are some of the questions patients diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) have to pose. On Episode 14 of Raw Talk Podcast, we sit down with Dr. Felix Ratjen (Division Chief of Paediatric Respiratory Medicine at The Hospital for Sick Children, Senior Scientist at the Research Institute in the Translational Medicine research program, and co-lead of the CF Centre at SickKids) to discuss CF, from its cause to current treatments, and how his research has not only prolonged but improved quality of life in CF patients. We also feature our second \"Classics\" segment on this episode, highlighting Dr. Lap-Chee Tsui's remarkable research contributions to the field of CF, which was conducted right here at The Hospital for Sick Children! Finally, we unveil our first ever \"Patient Perspective\" segment as we sit down with the very awesome and humble, Jeremie Saunders, to discuss his experiences after being diagnosed with CF and how this inspired him to start the amazing SickBoy podcast!
